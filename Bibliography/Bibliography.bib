  abstract = {Water security is a major concern for water-scarce cities that face dynamic water challenges due to limited water supply, climate change and increasing water demand. Framing urban water security is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainties of the definitions and assessment frameworks concerning urban water security. Several studies have assessed water security by granting priority indicators equal weight without considering or adapting to the local conditions. This study develops a new urban water security assessment framework with application to the water-scarce city of Madaba, Jordan. The study applies the new assessment framework on the study area and measures urban water security using the integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a decision management tool to prioritise and distinguish indicators that affect the four dimensions of urban water security: drinking water, ecosystems, climate change and water-related hazards, and socioeconomic aspects (DECS). The integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) highlights the state of water security and intervention strategies in Madaba. The study reveals that urban water security in Madaba is satisfactory to meet basic needs, with shortcomings in some aspects of the DECS. However, Madaba faces poor security in terms of managing climate- and water-related risks. The IUWSI framework assists with a rational and evidence-based decision-making process, which is important for enhancing water resources management in water-scarce cities.},

In this work, we present an evaluation of the impact of urban geometry on the outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) in Singapore, focusing on a new mixed-use high-rise development. Different urban design strategies/scenarios have been analyzed: two block forms, four street orientations (N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE), four street aspect ratios (from 1.5 to 3.5) and three building height profiles (arrangement of buildings based on height). The study is based on modelling techniques. Each scenario was analyzed for seven representative weather conditions during the year. The results are analyzed with specific metrics that take into account the spatial and temporal OTC variations. The results are conditioned by prevailing low winds and high frequency of cloudy days. The best OTC levels are observed on high street aspect ratios (2.5--3) and on N-S oriented streets. Although, on a yearly perspective the streets oriented NE-SW show the worst OTC performance, deviation from the acceptable range is not high. Higher differences between street orientations are encountered for specific weather types. The outcomes provide adequate urban parameters for high-rise developments to improve OTC in hot and humid tropical regions. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Factors associated with subprime mortgages, poor and non-existent underwriting loan requirements, weak regulatory oversight, exaggerated credit ratings, under-capitalization in the banking sector and excessive speculative activity in the housing market have been addressed by regulation, which is aimed at preventing another financial crisis similar to 2007--2009. Equally important, major fundamental factors affecting real estate valuation are providing support for the housing market and housing prices; these factors are impacting both the demand and supply side of the housing market. The factors include the lack of inventories of homes available for sale, the underproduction of housing, decreased household mobility limiting supply and the increase in housing demand from millennials and institutional investors; these fundamental factors were not evident during the 2007--2009 period. Despite a number of indicators signaling a potential topping out and overvaluation of housing prices, the authors conclude that the fundamental factors will limit the extent that the housing market weakens over the next few years. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

To this end, local policy makers need to identify the most thermally vulnerable areas within cities. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme highlights local-scale variations; however, its classes, although highly valuable, are to a certain extent generalized in order to be universally applicable. High spatial resolution indicators have the potential to better reflect city-specific challenges; in this paper, the Urban Heat Exposure (UHeatEx) indicator is developed, integrating the physical processes that drive the urban heat island (UHI). In particular, the urban form is modeled using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques, and used to estimate the canyon aspect ratio and the storage heat flux. The Bowen ratio is calculated using the aerodynamic resistance methodology and downscaled remotely sensed surface temperatures. The anthropogenic heat flux is estimated via a synergy of top-down and bottom-up inventory approaches. UHeatEx is applied to the city of Athens, Greece; it is correlated to air temperature measurements and compared to the LCZs classification. The results reveal that UHeatEx has the capacity to better reflect the strong intra-urban variability of the thermal environment in Athens, and thus can be supportive for adaptation responses. High-resolution climate projections from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble for the region show that the adverse effects of the existing thermal inequity are expected to worsen in the coming decades. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) has a significant effect on the health and well-being of urban dwellers. One of the key factors contributing to the tempo-spatial variation of thermal comfort in urban neighbourhoods is the geometrical characteristics. This paper develops a novel modelling framework to comprehensively evaluate the tempo-spatial thermal comfort performance of neighbourhoods on the basis of geometrical features. A weighted temporal thermal comfort performance (TCPw) metric is furthermore proposed to translate the thermal comfort results to a comparative performance criterion. Universal thermal climate index (UTCI) is the index chosen as baseline for assessing this metric. To demonstrate the practicality of the developed framework, three urban areas with different morphological character in climate zone of Tehran are investigated. Different geometrical variables of these locations are initially extracted from existing datasets using geographic information systems (GIS). A high-resolution spatial model is then developed to simulate thermal comfort of the neighbourhoods by coupling an energy simulation model (EnergyPlus) and a thermal comfort plugin (Ladybug). The model is successfully validated against a series of in-situ measurement data. Results indicate that differences in comfort performance are related to the simultaneous effects of neighbourhoods' layout (density, open areas), and street canyons' profiles (aspect ratio, orientation). {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Researchers identified the effect of urban morphology's geometry, shape, orientation, and mass-space combination on climate change. Also, the influential role of urban greenspaces in enhancing thermal comfort has been studied. Some results show that strengthening urban greenspaces, regardless of the orientation and proportions of the surrounding space, in some cases can prevent the proper circulation of airflow and adverse effects on thermal comfort. In this research, 10 models of neighborhoods in Tehran (the capital of Iran) were studied based on numerical calculation methods and CFD simulations. These simulations are performed by ENVI-met software, which is well-known software in this field. This study investigates which pattern and geometry in the composition of these spaces, with a constant fraction of the building, green spots, and water and paths, could better enhance thermal comfort. The results show that patterns with non-linear structure and a mass of porous spaces in which green spots are scattered have the best results in enhancing thermal comfort. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Climate change is escalating the threat of heat stress to global public health, with the majority of humans today facing increasingly severe and prolonged heat waves. Accurate weather data reflecting the complexity of measuring heat stress is crucial for reducing the impact of extreme heat on health worldwide. Previous studies have employed Heat Index (HI) and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) metrics to understand extreme heat exposure, forming the basis for heat stress guidelines. However, systematic comparisons of meteorological and climate data sets used for these metrics and the related parameters, like air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation crucial for human thermoregulation, are lacking. We compared three heat measures (HImax, WBGTBernard, and WBGTLiljegren) approximated from gridded weather data sets (ERA5-Land, PRISM, Daymet) with ground-based data, revealing strong agreement from HI and WBGTBernard (R2 0.76-0.95, RMSE 1.69-6.64 degrees C). Discrepancies varied by Koppen-Geiger climates (e.g., Adjusted R2 HImax 0.88-0.95, WBGTBernard 0.79-0.97, and WBGTLiljegren 0.80-0.96), and metrological input variables (Adjusted R2 Tmax 0.86-0.94, Tmin 0.91-0.94, Wind 0.33, Solarmax 0.38, Solaravg 0.38, relative humidity 0.51-0.74). Gridded data sets can offer reliable heat exposure assessment, but further research and local networks are vital to reduce measurement errors to fully enhance our understanding of how heat stress measures link to health outcomes. Extreme heat threatens human health. Rising intensity and duration of heat days expose more to hot environments. To understand how extreme heat affects human health, it is important to use accurate weather information and measures that reflect people's actual experience of the heat. Heat Index (HI) and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) are commonly used heat stress metrics that are widely used to set exposure guidelines and policies. However, there have been limited comparisons between daily heat measures and weather variables. In this study, we compared three heat measures (HI, WBGTBernard, and WBGTLiljegren) derived from three widely used gridded weather data sets (ERA5-Land, PRISM, and Daymet) with ground-based weather observations. The heat measures calculated from both the gridded weather data and the station data showed a reasonably strong agreement. However, the differences varied depending on the climate types. Gridded weather data sets can provide a reliable approach to assessing heat exposure and impacts based on meteorological variables to produce heat measures. However, further research and the establishment of local ground station networks are necessary to reduce measurement errors in exposure and improve accuracy. This will help us better understand the relationship between heat measures and their impact on health outcomes. Compared heat stress measures using gridded data sets and in situ data from 17 institutions across 42 states in the contiguous USObserved variations in heat measures and weather variables align with Koppen-Geiger climate classificationsInstalling more Wet Bulb Globe Temperature-measuring stations in diverse microclimates is key to better heat exposure prevention strategies},

Therefore, efficient city management must assess whether the population has access to green areas and the areas' quality in relation to, for example, vegetation, facilities or furnishings. Therefore, the objective is to establish environmental justice of urban parks in Tarragona (Spain) by developing a Park Quality Index (PQI) and the sociodemographic characteristics (level of studies, Human Development Index --HDI--, home sale and rental prices) of the population living within 300 m of a park. To prepare this, a GIS-integrated Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was produced. The results show that the green areas have low accessibility and availability and that most parks obtain an average-low PQI, with the best-valued aspect being the vegetation and the worst being the facilities. Regarding the degree of environmental justice, a causal relationship between the PQI and the indicators used emerges. The average value of the home sale prices is the one that shows the greatest correlation. These results can be used together with participatory procedures as a basis for identifying places with greater inequality, and for selecting the more effective actions that enable increasing environmental justice with respect to green areas. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.},

Since it first appearance in 2000, the system has been widely quoted, adapted and used in a large number of projects both for internal performance assessment and metric benchmarking. Water professionals have benefited from a coherent and flexible system, with precise and detailed definitions that in many cases have become a standard. The system has proven to be adaptable and it has been used in very different contexts for diverse purposes. The Performance Indicators System can be used in any organization regardless of its size, nature (public, private, etc.) or degree of complexity and development. The third edition of Performance Indicators for Water Supply Services represents a further improvement of the original manual. It contains a reviewed and consolidated version of the indicators, resulting from the real needs of water companies worldwide that were expressed during the extensive field testing of the original system. The indicators now properly cover bulk distribution and the needs of developing countries, and all definitions have been thoroughly revised. The confidence grading scheme has been simplified and the procedure to assess the results- uncertainty has been significantly enhanced. In addition to the updated contents of the original edition, a large part of the manual is now devoted to the practical application of the system. Complete with simplified step-by-step implementation procedures and case studies, the manual provides guidelines on how to adapt the IWA concepts and indicators to specific contexts and objectives. This new edition of Performance Indicators for Water Supply Services is valuable reference source for all those concerned with managing the performance of the water supply industry, including those in the water utilities as well as regulators, policy-makers and financial agencies.},

However, decreasing energy subsidies have compelled urban residents to rethink housing and transportation choices. This article attempts to explore the combined housing and transportation affordability in Jeddah. We collected primary data on housing and transport costs through an online survey in addition to the secondary data sources. The global Moran's index and the local indicator of spatial association (LISA) were then used to explore the spatial clustering of combined affordability of housing and transportation. Moreover, a composite index was developed to identify future locations of district-level affordable housing. Results reveal that more than one quarter of the total respondents are willing to change their housing locations in the future; and housing and transportation (un)affordability is clustered at certain locations. This study recommends considering transportation and housing costs in an integrated way at the time of granting new planning permissions. The study emphasizes an immediate need for a rapid, affordable, and reliable public transportation system offering connectivity, as well as infill development in the areas that are affordable in terms of housing and transportation costs. {\copyright} 2020 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.},

The technical performance of this network was assessed using global performance index methods after modifying the performance levels as per local guidelines. A total of 37 operational performance indicators for the network were selected to carryout assessment. Overall operational performance showed high scores whereas some indicators showed unacceptable performance values. The network showed very high technical performance considering nodal pressures. The lower performance for pipe velocity may be attributed to the fact that the network is currently being utilized by 70\% of the population for which it was designed. The residual chlorine levels were within the acceptable range of the Public Authority for Water (PAW) showing a very good performance by virtue of water quality. This study will be useful for the decision makers to assess the operational, technical and water quality performance of urban networks and take actions for improvements.},

The study used different estimators to overcome the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems of panel data and adopted many diagnostic tests to increase robustness. The findings of panel least square, generalized least square, and instrumental variables of the two-stage least squares regression approach showed that three HAI proxies - households' housing-related expenditures, housing costs, and housing market proxies - had a significant positive impact on the sustainability paradigm. In contrast, the final two HAI proxies - housing allowance and housing quality -- significantly negatively impacted the sustainability paradigm. Regarding the control variables, population density had a significant positive impact on the sustainability paradigm indicators. However, GDP per capita growth had a significant negative impact on most of the sustainability paradigm indicators. The main conclusion is that decision-makers should prioritize making housing more affordable. This could be achieved by controlling rents and low-cost buildings. The OECD should explore alternative methods of support, such as providing low-interest loans or targeted assistance, to help families bear housing costs without negatively impacting their financial sustainability. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The results highlight the importance of the service provider size on both input and output operational indicators (suggesting the presence of economies of scale), the influence of the allocated personnel and water losses over expenditures and the essential role that the largest service providers attribute to certification policies (environmental and occupational health and safety). The largest and the certified service providers are mostly related to a concession-type governance model and predominantly of urban typology. The policy recommendations that can be driven from these results are the promotion of the aggregation of smaller service providers, the careful control of water losses and personnel allocation, as well as certification practices.},

This study developed a green index as an objective measure of greenness using street view images and assessed its predictive power along with that of other environmental amenities for metropolitan housing prices. Spatial interpolation was used to transform point data into areal data, enabling effective analysis of a dataset covering an entire metropolis. A series of hedonic models revealed that (1) street greenness is significantly and negatively associated with housing prices, (2) a traditional greenness indicator and the green index provide complementary information, indicating that they could be used for different purposes, and (3) environmental amenities, in general, demonstrated significant relationships with housing prices. Our analysis strategy including spatial interpolation can be widely employed for studies using different types of data. The findings demonstrating a complementary relationship between our two greenness indicators provide valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to improve street-level greenness and green accessibility.

Exploring spatial and temporal variation of residential land prices and the effect of land market factors on residential land prices can help the government formulate targeted regulations and policies. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution of residential land prices and the factors influencing the land market in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region based on land transaction data from 2014-2017 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show the following: ? Residential land prices in Beijing and Tianjin are significantly higher than those in other regions, while Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and western mountainous areas have the lowest residential land prices. Over time, a development trend of residential land price polycentricity gradually emerged, and the locational correlation has gradually increased. ? Under the influence of the land finance model of local governments in China, three factors, namely, the land stock utilization rate, revenue from residential land transfers, and the growth of residential land transaction areas, have significantly contributed to the increase in residential land prices. ? Under the land market supply and demand mechanism and government management, four indicators, namely, the land supply rate, the per capita residential land supply area, the degree of marketization of the residential land supply, and the frequency of residential land transactions, have suppressed the rise in residential land prices. ? The overall effect of land market factors on residential land prices in the central and northern regions of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is stronger than that in the southern regions, which may be related to the more active land market and stricter macromanagement policies in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas.},

Using uniform standard meteorological measurements and questionnaire surveys, our study conducted an OTC study in urban parks in Beijing, Xi'an and Hami; representative of cities in China's cold regions. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was used as the thermal comfort index, and differences in residents' thermal perceptions and outdoor thermal benchmarks among these cities were compared. Results showed that: 1) air temperature (Ta) and globe temperature (Tg) were two primary factors affecting residents' thermal sensations in the three cities during winter. Residents' thermal sensation in Beijing and Hami was negatively correlated with wind speed (Va). Residents in Xi'an and Hami preferred a higher relative humidity (RH). Residents in Beijing and Hami preferred a lower Va to improve OTC related to local climatic characteristics. 2) Xi'an residents had the highest neutral UTCI (NUTCI) (17.3 {$^\circ$}C), followed by Beijing (17.0 {$^\circ$}C) and Hami (6.4 {$^\circ$}C). Xi'an residents had slightly wider neutral UTCI range (NUTCIR) (7.9--26.7 {$^\circ$}C) compared to Beijing (8.7--25.4 {$^\circ$}C), while Hami residents had the narrowest NUTCIR (1.5--11.3 {$^\circ$}C).

  abstract = {The Portuguese housing market underwent major transformations between 2010 and 2020. Until then, a delicate but resentful stability had long existed, with distorted rent schemes and low annual price increases proportional to the national economy and the income of the Portuguese population. After the financial crisis, several internal and external variables converged to dramatically change this scenario. In recent years, a growing number of researchers have centred their attention on the difficulties that the Portuguese urban middle-class populations are facing in trying to find homes. This paper analyses these challenges and their impact quantitatively, focusing on the affordability of housing for purchase or rent and considering synthetic indicators for average household incomes in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2019. The results show that the cost of buying or renting a house in the main Portuguese urban system has become much more detached from local incomes. The article concludes with reflections on the structural reasons for the enduring inequalities in the housing markets and the difficulties recognising territorial cohesion and spatial justice as important elements shaping urban and housing policies in Portugal. {\copyright} 2020, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Sociology.

For this, three case studies (base case, case 1, and case 2) of outdoor thermal comfort were evaluated, in which the Envi-met software was used to emulate and evaluate the thermal performance of these strategies during March (highest temperature month) and October (rainier month). The strategies used were extracted from the contrast of zebra skin, human skin, evaporative cooling, and ant skin. The results showed a reduction of 2.8 degrees C in the air temperature at 11:00, the radiant temperature decreased by 2.2 degrees C, and the PET index managed to reduce the thermal comfort indicator among its categories. The importance of thinking based on biomimicry in sustainable strategies is concluded; although significant changes were obtained, high risks of discomfort persist due to the layout and proximity of the building.},

The study identified that there is a significantly higher concentration of pollutants in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. In urban areas, the UHI indicator shows a strong positive correlation with pollutants like CO, NO2, and O3, a weaker positive correlation with HCHO, and aerosols, and a weak negative correlation with SO2. A comprehensive framework to analyse the combined impact of pollutants, yielding insights into cumulative atmospheric pollution levels -UPI indicator is proposed in this study.

  abstract = {Water security is a global concern because of the growing impact of human activities and climate change on water resources. Studies had been performed at global, country, and city level to assess the water security issues. However, assessment of water security at a domestic scale is lacking. This paper develops a new domestic water security assessment framework accounting for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene through twelve indicators. Water supply, sanitation, and hygiene are central to key water-related sustainable development goals. The framework is subsequently applied to the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. From the domestic water security assessment of Addis Ababa, the water supply dimension was found to be of good level, whereas the sanitation and hygiene dimensions were of poor and fair level, respectively, indicating both a challenge and an opportunity for development. Because the analysis is spatially explicit at the city-branch level (in Addis), variation in domestic water security performance across Addis Ababa can be assessed, allowing efficient targeting of scant resources (financial, technical, personnel). Analysis further shows that a lack of institutional capacity within the utility, existing infrastructure leading to lock-in' and hindering maintenance and upgrade initiatives, and an unreliable power supply are the main issues leading to poor domestic water security in the study city. These areas should be tackled to improve the current situation and mitigate future problems. The developed framework is generic enough to be applied to other urban and peri-urban areas, yet provides planners and policy makers with specific information on domestic water security considering water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and accounting for within-city variability. This work could therefore have practical applicability for water service providers.},

The development of the framework leverages the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and the HM Land Registry Price Paid Data is ingested into the framework as the base transactions data. 1.1 million London based transaction records between January 2011 and December 2020 have been exploited for model design and evaluation. The proposed framework also leverages a range of neighborhood data including the location of rail stations, supermarkets and bus stops to explore the possible impact on house prices. Five machine learning algorithms have been exploited and three evaluation metrics have been presented and with a focus on RMSE. Results show that an increase in the variety of parameters enables improved accuracy which ultimately will enable decision making. The potential for future work based on this paper can explore the impact of the introduction of other groups of data on the accuracy of machine learning models designed for the estimation of house prices. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {Climate change and water are intricately linked. Water is the primary medium through which the impacts of climate change will be felt. Securing the water sector and enhancing water security is, therefore, imperative for any adaptive response to climate change. A precursor in improving water security is to first establish a mechanism to measure it. Only then can incremental and progressive actions be evaluated. This study has developed such a mechanism in the form of a water security assessment framework using an indictor-based methodology. The framework is developed for city-scale analysis because analyses at this scale is more useful in operationalizing water security enhancement. The framework has a three-layered structure comprising five dimensions (broad elements of water security), twelve indicators (areas of interest within the dimensions), and a set of potential variables that can be used to quantify the indicators. The framework has been developed to foster practical interventions for water security enhancement and not as a comparative tool for benchmarking. Hence, while the dimensions and indicators of the framework are fixed, the choice of variables is up to the city depending upon its context. This aspect of the framework, therefore, is meant to help cities introspect internally and move up the water security ladder. The framework culminates into a Water Security Index (WSI), measured on a scale from one to five. The scale is linear and hierarchical in its grade value. The framework was successfully used to assess the water security situation of Bangkok. The study also makes a case for scaling up this intervention for other major cities in Thailand, which can then help implement some of Thailand's key climate change adaptation initiatives such as the Nationally Determined Contributions and the National Climate Change Master Plan.},

  abstract = {Optimal scheduling of pumps in water distribution systems (WDSs) entails reducing operational cost while supplying the required water quality and quantity. The combined use of pumps, however, can increase breakage rate of aging pipes due to high internal pressure. Multi-objective optimization (MO) is crucial in the determination of a trade-off between the two objective functions, minimization of the operational cost and maximization of the velocity reliability index. The velocity reliability index is used as a surrogate metric to quantify the structural performance of the pipes. The optimization process requires repetitive hydraulic simulations resulting in high computational cost. This paper proposes a Gaussian-Process (GP) based sequential approaches that efficiently estimate the optimal Pareto front with reduced computational effort. The technique simultaneously optimizes the two objective functions over a box-constrained domain where each GP model is fitted independently through an infill criterion that balances the space exploration (search of new observations) and exploitation (local improvement around existing observations). The reduced computational cost allows running full hydraulic simulations during the optimization process permitting real time decision making for pumps schedule in large complex WDSs. Utility of the proposed technique was applied for Asmara's WDSs, composed of 9 pumping stations and 12 storage tanks, and showed good performance of the GP based optimization compared to traditional evolutionary optimization techniques (such as NSGA2 and Particle Swarm Optimization). The GP-MO only requires 20 iterations to identify the optimal Pareto front while, even with more than 1000 generations, the NSGA2 is not getting to find a good agreement between the two objective functions. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.}

Water supply in urban areas is frequently held accountable by local administrative bodies across the world. In India, several Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) import water from long distances. Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, has devised nine Service Level Benchmarks (SLB) indicators to evaluate the performance of ULBs in water supply management. The present study considered 30 million-plus Indian cities with low surface water availability. The data pertaining to the population, surface water availability, and SLB performance were collected for the selected cities. The data were then used to find the effect of eight SLB performance indicators on the per capita water supply (PCS) indicator using correlation matrices and multiple regression, where PCS is considered as the only dependent variable. The findings indicate that coverage of water supply connections (COV), extent of metering of connections (MTR), extent of non-revenue water (NRW), and continuity of water supply (CNT) have considerable effects on the PCS. The study is helpful for the ULBs and Policymakers to understand the association between PCS and other indicators and make the intervention for an effective urban water supply management.}

In the second stage, operational and commercial indicators were determined for both Sectors selected as the most suitable for comparison, in this case the 12th Sector and the 23rd Sector. In the last stage, an analysis of the economic sustainability of selected Sectors was performed. It was verified that 04 of the 39 WSSs collect raw water from a surface water source, while the other 35 WSSs use deep wells (about 270 meters deep) to collect water from Pirabas artesian aquifer. In addition, operational efficiency indicators were calculated, such as the "Distribution Losses Index" - 69,08\% (12th Sector) and 72,67\% (23rd Sector), and economic sustainability indicators, such as the "Total Expense with the Services per Billed Cubic Meter" - R\$1,92/m3 (12th Sector) and R\$1,29/m3 (23rd Sector). In conclusion, due to the classification of both studied Sectors, regarding operational efficiency and economic sustainability, as inefficient and partially sustainable respectively, it is recommended to improve the operational and comercial management of the regional concessionaire, in compliance with the premises of Law No. 14.026/2020 and to ensure the economic and financial balance of the service provider.},

The scientific rigor of the methodology was based on the precepts of design science research. The methods proposed for the construction of functionalities and the application of the reference indicators provided an optimized analysis of water consumption and the detection of excess consumption and leaks. The methodology, implemented in an online prototype, AquaBIM, could deliver a significant advance for building management. A conceptual test of AquaBIM evaluated the consumption indicators and validated our methodology through its application in a commercial building. The building consumption analyses showed a potential for approximately 15\% savings. In addition, five requirements of the international sustainability certification AQUAHQE were met. The results of our research provide an innovative approach for the automation of sustainable building management and could be expanded to monitor and report on the consumption of other critical resources such as electricity and gas.},

This study focuses on the performance evaluation of an urban WDN using fuzzy logic-based aggregation of reliability, resilience, and vulnerability indices. To assess the individual performance indicators, this study advocates the pressure-dependent analysis (PDA) for the hydraulic simulation. Furthermore, it advocates a fuzzy rule-based aggregated performance index (API) that will deliver the outcome in linguistic form and help the decision-maker to prioritize the maintenance of the WDN. The proposed method is illustrated with the help of a real-time WDN for part of Dire Dawa city in Ethiopia. It has been found that the API values for this network are 0.721 and 0.624, respectively, under normal and abnormal conditions, which are just satisfactory. It has been noticed that nodes J4, J44, J47, and J49 are critical from the overall low API. Efforts should be made to improve the hydraulic and residual chlorine conditions at these nodes to increase the API. It is felt that such a methodology will help the decision-makers in improving the performance of an existing urban WDN.},

The turbulence-resolving PALM is able to simulate the urban boundary layer flow for realistic setups. Besides an accurate representation of the relevant physical processes, the model performance also depends on the input data describing the urban setup, namely the building and land-surface properties. Two types of scenario are employed. The first one is the synthetic scenarios altering mainly surface and material parameters such as albedo, emissivity or wall conductivity, testing sensitivity of the model simulations to potentially erroneous input data. Second, urbanistic-type scenarios are analysed, in which commonly considered urban heat island mitigation measures such as greening of the streets or changing surface materials are applied in order to assess the limits of the effects of a particular type of scenario. For the synthetic scenarios, surface parameters used in radiation balance equations are found to be the most sensitive overall followed by the volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of walls. Other parameters show a limited average effect; however, some can still be significant during some parts of the day, such as surface roughness in the morning hours. The second type, the urbanistic scenarios, shows urban vegetation to be the most effective measure, especially when considering both physical and biophysical temperature indica-tors. The influence of both types of scenario was also tested for air quality, specifically PM2.5 dispersion, which generally shows opposite behaviour to that of thermal indicators; i.e. improved thermal comfort brings deterioration of PM2.5 concentrations.},

We find contemporaneously that while people born in the 1980s have a high likelihood of falling below the affordability threshold, older people have a lower likelihood of recovering.

The results contend that benchmarking is public sector reform by other means. Quantification allows performance benchmarking to escape the scrutiny and controversy that follows market-led reform, even though both privilege economic efficiency at the expense of distributional equity. Benchmarking experts advance economisation, a process that, through economic reasoning, metrics and quantitative comparisons, transforms water utilities into calculative Pareto-maximising entities that privilege existing consumers to the detriment of the unserved. Economisation is not inevitable, however. Heterodox experts can choose different benchmarking methods to advance alternative values. Two professors in India, for instance, introduced explicitly equity-focused indicators into the country's water utility benchmarking system, challenging the prevailing orthodoxy. Nonetheless, while fairer benchmarking systems have the potential to reduce resource inequities, they also risk domesticating power relations.}

The need to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of UHI in the context of urban expansion is crucial for sustainable urban planning. The aim of this study was to quantify the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) and urbanization, assess the expansion process of UHI, and analyze its connectivity in order to develop strategies to mitigate UHI in an urban context over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020. Using remote sensing data, LULC changes were analyzed with a random forest model. LULC change rate (LCCR), land cover intensity (LCI), and landscape expansion index (LEI) were calculated to quantify urbanization. The land surface temperature for the study period was calculated using the mono-window algorithm. The UHI effect was analyzed using an integrated radius and non-linear regression approach, fitting SUHI data to polynomial curves and identifying turning points based on the regression derivative for UHI intensity belts to quantify the expansion and intensification of UHI. Landscape metrics such as the aggregation index (AI), landscape shape index (LSI), and four other matrices were calculated to assess UHI morphology and connectivity of the UHI. In addition, the LEI was adopted to measure the extent of UHI growth patterns.

Prior research has focused on the difficulties that resettlement poses for the affected families in terms of their capacity to meet the demands of the new community. This study suggests that resettlement (built environment) quality may act as a predictor and influence the residential satisfaction and quality of life of project-affected families. This study investigates how residential satisfaction influences the relationship between the quality of the dwelling, the context of resettlement homes, and the quality of life of mining-affected families in Ghana. A sample of 256 household heads displaced by a large-scale mining project in Ellembelle was used to evaluate the suggested model. The findings indicate that resettlement quality greatly enhances the quality of life of the mining-affected families. The findings also revealed that residential satisfaction was a significant mediator of the quality of dwellings and the context of the resettlement, in addition to being a strong predictor of quality of life. Indirectly, resident characteristics, such as socioeconomic and demographic conditions, influenced how people felt about their homes and quality of life. These results indicate that residential satisfaction and resettlement quality are accurate indicators of the mining-affected families' quality of life. Integrating these features make it possible to quantify the mining-affected families' quality of life for future research and public policy. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {This article puts forward the notion of socio-technical resistance with an application to the regulation through performance indicators in the water sector. Governance failures are mainly explained by concentrating on governance design, considering regulation as a set of control mechanisms. We propose an alternative perspective by putting the emphasis on socio-technical resistance to take into account both human and non-human actors in the governance process. We observe the misuse of performance indicators by local actors in urban water systems in Europe to highlight the empirical significance of socio-technical resistance. Results support that socio-technical resistance is frequent and reduces significantly the reliability of the information gathered through performance indicators. Drawing on a new typology of resistance, we show socio-technical resistance is a dynamic combination of cognitive, interpretative, territorial, strategic, technical and structural factors. These results and the proposed notion underline a crucial limitation of public policies and regulation in the process of policy-instruments implementation and compliance. Empirically, it reveals particularly relevant to provide new insights on New public management and performance-based regulation, where measurement are crucial.}

  abstract = {The urban heat island effect exacerbates independent climate change-induced shifts toward longer, stronger, and more frequent heat extremes. Environmental inequity, driven by a history of racially motivated urban planning policies, has led particular demographics to bear the worst impacts of urban heat exposure and thus also climate change. These impacts cause adverse health outcomes in the form of heat emergencies. Through a novel demographic and spatial analysis of heat-related illness Emergency Medical Services data from Richmond, Virginia, this study investigates the relationships between heat health emergencies and intra-urban heat islands quantified through three heat exposure metrics. We also evaluate the accessibility of built refuge from urban heat in the form of public transit infrastructure, libraries, and government cooling centers in relation to these emergencies. We found that heat emergencies are inequitably distributed among racial, age, and socioeconomic groups in Richmond, particularly among residents identified as Male, Black or African American, 50+ years old, and experiencing mental health, intoxication, and/or homelessness. We found significant associations between the location of these heat emergencies and urban heat islands as estimated from remotely-sensed surface and community science-derived air temperature metrics, but not a co-estimated heat index. We also found that available refuge facilities are insufficiently located to protect individuals with reduced mobility across areas with the highest number of heat-related health emergencies. Community involvement in the mitigation and management of extreme heat threats, especially for those disproportionately impacted, is necessary to decrease the number of summertime heat illnesses. In a process called the urban heat island effect, urban areas experience higher average temperatures compared to nearby rural areas, largely due to the lack of cooling provided by trees and the heat-trapping ability of buildings and paved surfaces. While human-caused climate change is driving average global temperatures to rise, some communities and neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia experience hotter temperatures than others. This is largely due to a historical lack of government investment in Black and low-income neighborhoods. Hotter, less resourced neighborhoods experience more heat-related health emergencies like heat stroke and heat exhaustion. This study found significant relationships between the location of heat-related illness Emergency Medical Services data from Richmond, Virginia and areas which are measurably hotter. We also found that Richmond has insufficient publicly accessible places for people with limited mobility to escape the heat, including bus stop shelters, libraries, and government cooling centers. Richmonders bear the brunt of heat emergencies unequally, with a higher proportion of heat emergencies among residents identified as Male, Black or African American, 50+ years old, and experiencing mental health, intoxication, and/or homelessness. Impacted community members should be prioritized as cities like Richmond addresses the everyday impacts of climate change and urban heat.

However, extreme seasons occur later for heat stress than temperature by up to 2 months within the tropics. By 2100, models project a drying that hampers the increase in heat stress extremes. Within northeastern Africa, the slight projected wettening enhances the warming effect on the heat stress changes and induces the maximum heat stress intensification. Models are generally able to represent the phasing of both extremes compared to observations, with large uncertainties over regions experiencing the greatest future heat stress intensification. {\copyright}2019.

The thermal response of built-up areas in comparison to natural areas is quantified in terms of surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity. The work presented here evaluates the seasonal SUHI intensities in Delhi using local climate zones (LCZs) and conventional SUHI indicators in parallel. Statistical analyses are carried out to determine the relationship between them and to delineate heat stressed zones in the Delhi city region. The present study is the first one that utilizes LCZs for seasonal SUHI analysis in Delhi. The land surface temperature (LST) is assessed using a hundred and five night-time images from MODIS. Unambiguous night-time SUHI effect is seen for all seasons. The maximum night-time SUHI intensity is 3.5{$^\circ$} C, between 'compact low-rise' (LCZ 3) and 'low plants' (LCZ D) in summer and winter. The conventional indicator 'Inside urban-Inside rural' gives the highest night-time SUHI intensity of 3.3{$^\circ$} C, in autumn. Statistical analyses show that 'compact low-rise' (LCZ3) and 'large low-rise' (LCZ8) are the most heat-stressed LCZs. The largest number of distinct thermal zones is created in the monsoon, followed by summer and winter. The results suggest that in order to minimize the UHI effect, further urban expansion in the Delhi region should be restricted to LCZ 5 (open mid-rise) and LCZ 6 (open low-rise). {\copyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

Due to climate change, heatwaves are already increasing negatively impact outdoor laborers and activities. However, calculating heat stress on a global scale is disparaged due to the interplay and treatment of temperature, humidity, and radiation. To help resolve this issue, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), a standardized heat stress metric, is implemented into the Community Land Model (CLM5), the land surface component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM2). This resolves a long lasting, complex issue within global heat stress: the treatment of solar and thermal radiation. A default configuration of CLM5 is executed and shows the advantages of simulating the WBGT within multiple environments. Additionally, two commonly used WBGT approximations are implemented for solar exposed (sWBGT) and shaded (FiWBGT) conditions. The 1995 Chicago Heatwave is examined as a case study, focusing on the rural regions impacted by the heatwave. Derivative functions of labor capacity show that assumptions about calculating a non-linear algorithm generate non-negligible biases that can grossly over or underestimate the impact of heat stress on future climate change projections. For example, a difference of 0.5{$^\circ$}C from WBGT can result in {\textquestiondown}10},

Climate change is affecting thermal comfort conditions (TCCs) negatively. Therefore, it is important to estimate their past and future trends to take accurate measures for mitigation and adaptation efforts in especially urban areas. However, it is difficult to calculate TCCs for the future since they are the combined effect of several meteorological parameters on a person outdoor together with her/his own physiological characteristics, which must be evaluated individually. This study is aimed at determining the TCCs trends in the past compared to the present whilst estimating the future conditions using a new methodology in the case of Kayseri city in the Interior Anatolia Region of Turkey. As the result of the study, all the change trends considering temporal and spatial results show that thermal comfort conditions signal warmer and higher heat stress in the past and future trends. This means human thermal sensation ranges (e.g., very cold) have replaced with the next warmer range, and their spatial distribution in percentage has also changed towards warmer. Increase in the prevalence of unfavourable thermal comfort conditions causes the decrease in the liveability indicators in especially urban areas, including serious economic loses based on energy consumption, health care expenses, and efficiency of activities. It is required that both past and expected future trends be considered in the planning and design works to make cities resilient and have higher adaptive capacity to climate change. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In particular, park-and-ride areas that are publicly owned can be leveraged to support TOD uses, such as affordable housing, office space, small businesses, and mixed-use buildings given their convenient access to transit systems and often large land areas. However, few previous studies have discussed the use of publicly owned park-and-rides, which are an important component of publicly owned land, as a catalyst for TOD. To fill the gap in the literature and effectively support TOD planning, this research developed a multi-criteria prioritization tool to identify the most promising locations for TOD and tested it at three park-and-ride sites owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. The tool was developed through the Delphi process, which is an effective and inexpensive approach to evaluate relevant indicators by synthesizing the opinions of experts from various backgrounds. Five categories with a total of 14 TOD indicators, including transit supportive land-use zoning, job accessibility, land price, land-use mix, and household income, were selected as measures of TOD suitability. The importance of these indicators varied with three different TOD scenarios: (1) emphasis on affordable housing, (2) emphasis on market-rate housing, and (3) emphasis on mixed-use development. Using the calculated suitability scores, this tool can prioritize potential TOD sites for further review. {\copyright} 2023},

It analyzes and compares spatial differentiation and influencing factors of different residential areas and houses with different prices in Wuhan by spatial differentiation indicators and geographic detector. The results show that residential areas are divergent due to differences in urban resource spatial structure, with few and concentrated high-quality residential areas. The spatial differentiation level of different residential areas also varies, with central location, landscape, educational resources, and other dominant scarce resources being the key to residential spatial differentiation in most of China's big cities. In addition, residential spatial differentiation can lead to issues including housing wealth inequality, resource deprivation, and class identity solidification. In the end, this paper puts forward policy implications on alleviating residential spatial differentiation and optimizing allocation of residential resources. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

This is more significant for firms operating in a public services' context and mainly when supplying a fundamental public resource, like water utilities. While the literature on sustainability reporting in the water sector is scant, there is an increasing need to study the usefulness and quality of its sustainability disclosures to adequately inform the stakeholders about the activities of water utilities to protect this fundamental resource and general sustainable development. This article presents a novel assessment framework based on a scoring technique and an empirical analysis on the sustainability reports of Italian water utilities carried out through it. The results highlight a low level of disclosure on the sustainability indicators suggested by the main sustainability reporting guidelines (Global Reporting Initiative, (GRI), and Sustainability Accounting Standard Board, (SASB)); most companies tend to disclose only qualitative information and fail to inform about some material aspects of water management, such as water recycled, network resilience, water sources, and effluent quality. These findings indicate that sustainability reporting is mainly considered as a communication tool, rather than a performance measurement and an accountability tool, but also suggest the need for a new and international industry-specific sustainability reporting standard.},

  abstract = {This study compares and discusses the adequacy of surrogate resilience metrics proposed in the literature for resilience assessment of drinking water systems concerning demand increase and network redundancy. A sensitivity analysis is carried out for increasing flow rates using a conceptual case study with different layouts and demand scenarios, selecting several metrics to assess the resilience of two real network areas. Resilience metrics based on surplus energy are sensitive to network layout and demand scenarios. The network resilience index considers hydraulic reliability and network diameter uniformity. In contrast, the weighted resilience index also considers the network topology and gives importance to pipes with higher flow rates. Entropy-based resilience metrics mainly rely on the network flows' uniformity and are sensitive to pipe redundancy. The entropy metric most adequate to assess the hydraulic capacity is the diameter-sensitive flow entropy, since it is sensitive to the velocity inside the pipes. Topology metrics cannot assess the hydraulic capacity though evaluate the system redundancy (meshed-ness coefficient), robustness (central-point dominance) and water transportation efficiency (average-path length). Surrogate resilience metrics do not assess the system performance during a failure. They indicate systems which are better prepared to overcome failure events and increased demand events, providing vital information to drinking water systems management. {\copyright} 2023.

A three-step approach is proposed: (i) System context analysis, identifying the main key factors that impact the WDN performance; (ii) Scenario definition, identifying the implicated WDN variables, describing its possible evolution, and conjugating them to further establish the reference scenario and the two most relevant and opposite ones; and (iii) Scenario modelling, simulating the WDN behaviour for those scenarios. The obtained spatial and temporal hydraulic results are further used to calculate performance metrics. The methodology is applied to a real WDN to assess resilience performance considering infrastructure asset robustness (real water loss performance indicator), service reliability (minimum pressure index), and service flexibility (network resilience index). A new formulation to assess the metric evolution over time is proposed, deducting the further-away performance results by using an uncertainty weight. The results demonstrate that the increase in metric amplitude for the opposite scenarios over time highlights future uncertainty, reflecting context uncertainty, and the comparison of metric spatial distribution (i.e., at the pipe/node levels) highlights critical areas with higher associated uncertainty. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

Second, we use the model to calibrate both a hard loan-to-value and a soft loan-to-income limit to smooth the Spanish house price cycle and match the amplitude of the UK equivalent. Finally, we characterise the effects of these calibrated policies over the different phases of the cycle, finding both instruments to reduce credit and price growth during the expansionary phase as well as to reduce their decline during the contractionary phase. Moreover, both instruments lead to a compositional shift in lending: the loan-to-value policy from first-time buyers to buy-to-let investors and the loan-to -income policy from both first-time buyers and home movers to buy-to-let investors.},

This study aims to investigate the effect of different urban morphologies such as high-rise and low-rise buildings, green areas, and water bodies on the urban microclimate in Singapore. Mobile measurements taken from a pedestrian perspective were conducted for the first time in the central area of Singapore to explore the severity of the UHI effect through distinctive urban morphologies. The Sky View Factor (SVF) was the metric used to quantify these characteristics. During daytime, the air temperature was higher when SVF increased, except for the water body area. Shading showed to be an important factor to decreasing air temperature in the tropics. Reductions by up to 4.5 degrees C were observed due to the buildings shading during daytime, while the cooling effect of vegetation reduced the air temperature by up to 4 degrees C during the daytime and 1 degrees C at night-time. Thus, this study revealed a strong relationship between the decrease in air temperature and greenery coverage in the city. Therefore, understanding the relationship between urban morphology and microclimate conditions may better drive sustainable urban planning and development in the tropics. Finally, it was demonstrated the importance of using mobile monitoring to retrieve granular data that allows identifying specific environmental issues on a hyperlocal scale, which would not be recognised through other monitoring techniques.},

The group fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is developed to determine indicator weights and to find out the key influencing factors. A combination of fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) and cloud model is introduced for measuring UWECC performance level. The integrated model includes two parts. One component is that fuzzy set theory is combined with evaluation methods, proposing a FSE method. The other part is that cloud model is utilized to make up for this limitation of ignoring the internal randomness and ambiguity for the FSE method. Subsequently, the UWECC of Shizuishan City in China is selected from 2010 to 2019 as a case study, the results show that its UWECC performance scores gradually increased in the past ten years, the growth speed of which can be divided into three development stages: bad and slow-growth (2010--2014), intermediate but slightly fast-growth (2015--2017) and good and fast-growth (2018--2019). Besides, through making sensitivity analysis of indicators to each subsystem, it is found that their sensitivities show obvious differences. In terms of the main obstacle indicators affecting UWECC performance, they also present obvious temporal heterogeneity characteristics, that is, the obstacle degrees of indicators in the same stage have slightly smaller differences, and those of indicators in different stages exist significant differences. The demonstration conducted proves that the proposed method can be used not only to accurately understand the changes of UWECC through time but also to diagnose the crucial obstacle indicators, providing theoretical basis for improving UWECC performance of this urban in the future. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.}

  abstract = {Surface temperature is often used to examine heat exposure in multi-city studies and for informing urban heat mitigation efforts due to scarcity of urban air temperature measurements. Cities also have lower relative humidity, traditionally not accounted for in large-scale observational urban heat risk assessments. Here, using crowdsourced measurements from over 40,000 weather stations in {$\approx$}600 urban clusters in Europe, we show the moderating effect of this urbanization-induced humidity reduction on outdoor heat stress during the 2019 heatwave. We demonstrate that daytime differences in heat index between urban clusters and their surroundings are weak, and associations of this urban-rural difference with background climate, generally examined from the surface temperature perspective, are diminished due to moisture feedbacks. We also examine the spatial variability of surface temperature, air temperature, and heat index within these clusters---relevant for detecting hotspots and potential disparities in heat exposure---and find that surface temperature is a poor proxy for the intra-urban distribution of heat index during daytime. Finally, urban vegetation shows much weaker ({$\sim$}1/6th as strong) associations with heat index than with surface temperature, which has broad implications for optimizing urban heat stress mitigation strategies. These findings are valid for operational metrics of heat stress for shaded conditions (apparent temperature and humidex), thermodynamic proxies (wet-bulb temperature), and empirical heat indices. Based on this large-scale empirical evidence, surface temperature, used due to the lack of better alternatives, may not be suitable for accurately informing heat mitigation strategies within and across cities, necessitating more urban-scale observations and better urban-resolving models. {\copyright} 2022.

Ninety-four percent of the US urban population (228 million) live in cities where heat stress burdens the poor, with heat stress inequities between white and non-white populations strongly associated with residential segregation. Similarly, historically redlined neighborhoods show higher heat stress than their non-redlined counterparts, demonstrating how historical segregation relates to present-day environmental inequalities.

  abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect is strongly modulated by urban-scale changes to the aerodynamic, thermal, and radiative properties of the Earth's land surfaces. Interest in this phenomenon, both from the climatological and public health perspectives, has led to hundreds of UHI studies, mostly conducted on a city-by-city basis. These studies, however, do not provide a complete picture of the UHI for administrative units using a consistent methodology. To address this gap, we characterize clear-sky surface UHI (SUHI) intensities for all urbanized areas in the United States using a modified Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) approach by combining a fusion of remotely-sensed data products with multiple US census-defined administrative urban delineations. We find the highest daytime SUHI intensities during summer (1.91 +/- 0.97 degrees C) for 418 of the 497 urbanized areas, while the winter daytime SUHI intensity (0.87 +/- 0.45 degrees C) is the lowest in 439 cases. Since urban vegetation has been frequently cited as an effective way to mitigate UHI, we use NDVI, a satellite-derived proxy for live green vegetation, and US census tract delineations to characterize how vegetation density modulates inter-urban, intra-urban, and inter-seasonal variability in SUHI intensity. In addition, we also explore how elevation and distance from the coast confound SUHI estimates. To further quantify the uncertainties in our estimates, we analyze and discuss some limitations of these satellite-derived products across climate zones, particularly issues with using remotely sensed radiometric temperature and vegetation indices as proxies for urban heat and vegetation cover. We demonstrate an application of this spatially explicit dataset, showing that for the majority of the urbanized areas, SUHI intensity is lower in census tracts with higher median income and higher proportion of white people. Our analysis also suggests that poor and non-white urban residents may suffer the possible adverse effects of summer SUHI without reaping the potential benefits (e.g., warmer temperatures) during winter, though establishing this result requires future research using more comprehensive heat stress metrics. This study develops new methodological advancements to characterize SUHI and its intra-urban variability at levels of aggregation consistent with sources of other socioeconomic information, which can be relevant in future inter-disciplinary research and as a possible screening tool for policy-making.

How to closely inspect the features and development of water security for the major cities in the basin and to compare the water security conditions between the major cities at the basin scope is a keystone to better support water management practice in the cities as well as regions. Hence, this study refined the previous framework by applying 19 indicators to describe the conditions of resource, infrastructure, waterway, efficiency, risk, and capacity and then integrated the data-driven weighting approach, the Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) method, to objectively evaluate the development and characteristics of water security of the megacities in the Yangtze River basin, i.e., Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Chengdu, during 2011-2017. Based on the aggregated scores, Chongqing had the best overall water security condition (0.696) in 2017, followed by Chengdu (0.613), Shanghai (0.581), Nanjing (0.496), and Wuhan (0.471). During 2011-2017, Chongqing and Shanghai had a greater improvement in the water security condition, while Wuhan had the least. From a basin perspective, the upstream megacities had the advantage of their water availability and depletion conditions, river quality, pollutant discharge, government's support of water affairs, and the societal investment in water conservancy. On the other hand, the middleand downstream megacities had shown the better performance of the water affordability, the density of the sewage network, and water intensity. The sensitivity analysis detected the average of the standard variations of the score changes as 2.03\% in the context of different indicator sets and thus assured the outcome robustness. This study enhances the assessment frameworks, facilitates the applications of temporal and spatial comparative evaluation of water security conditions on city and river basin level, and identifies the policy gaps for enhancing water management in the magacities and the basins.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The study carries out a comparative assessment of the outcomes of the indicators, and interlinks the plans, strategies, and policies of the cities with the indicators of the integrated framework to identify policy gaps and to suggest steps to improve urban water management in these five cities. Based on the results obtained, Hanoi currently has the best water security condition among these five cities. Despite the multiple dimensions of water security, the plans and policies formulated in the five cities focus mostly on water supply sanitation and human well-being among the dimensions pertinent to the framework.

Our in-and out-of-sample results show that house prices and corporate credit spreads predict real GDP growth better than residential investment and LC. Moreover, shocks to house prices and corporate credit spreads have a greater impact on real GDP growth and other macroeconomic indicators than shocks to LC and residential investment. Furthermore, house prices have the largest positive impact on inflation and the largest negative effect on unemployment.

  abstract = {Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a combined measure of temperature and humidity effects on thermal comfort, is used to define heat stress waves (HSWs). While emerging research has raised concerns on future changes in heat stress, for the first time, this study examines spatiotemporal changes in multiple HSW characteristics (intensity, duration, frequency, and cumulative mean intensity) in the 21st century under three emissions scenarios. It is the sustained nature of HSWs that impose more adverse impacts than extreme heat on a single day. HSWs are expected to be more intense, persistent, frequent, and influential due to anthropogenic influence. Models project the largest increases in multiple HSW characteristics will occur over the tropics and subtropics. The exception is maximum intensity, which displays a relative uniform increase over most global land areas. Analysis of regional population exposure to HSWs under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios emphasizes the importance of aggressive mitigation to minimize the potential impacts of HSWs. We further investigate how different regional HSW characteristics are projected to change relative to increasing global mean surface temperature (GMST). Our results confirm the varying rates and different trajectories at which regional HSWs change, independent of forcing pathway, strongly related to GMST. On both globally aggregated and regional scales, the maximum intensity and GMST are highly linearly associated, with an approximately 1:1 increase. However, the other three HSW characteristics are projected to change at a nonlinear rate per degree of GMST increase in general and display large regional variation in the rates of their changes. Plain Language Summary Besides air temperature, air humidity is another important factor in determining the impact of heat waves on humans. High humidity will reduce the efficiency of evaporative cooling and, when combined with high temperature, could pose a serious threat to human health or even life safety. Heat stress indices, taking into account both temperature and humidity effects, are considered to be better indicators of environmental conditions conducive to heat stress on human health. We here employ a widely used heat stress index, wet bulb globe temperature, to define heat waves, namely, heat stress waves (HSWs). Heat waves can be considered through a number of characteristics, and it is their distinctive characteristics that result in the vast array of adverse impacts. This also applies to HSWs. Our results show that more intense, longer-lasting, frequent, and influential HSWs are anticipated during the 21st century, and anthropogenic warming substantially increases the occurrence of HSWs. Except intensity, tropical regions will generally witness the largest increases in multiple HSW characteristics and the number of people that may be exposed to HSWs. Changes in HSW characteristics are confirmed not to depend on whether a particular warming is reached sooner or later; they are strongly related to global mean surface temperature.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of buildings is an important factor causing the spatial differences in the urban thermal environment. The study units were divided based on the urban road network, DEM, and building big data in Jinan. The Landsat 8 remote sensing images were used to invert the land surface temperature (LST), and Kriging interpolation was used to obtain the spatially continuous air temperature (AT). The integrated LST and AT represented the urban thermal environment. By constructing three-dimensional spatial distribution indicators of buildings and using analysis of variance and multiple correspondence analysis methods, the influence of the three-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of buildings on the urban thermal environment was comprehensively investigated. The results showed that all the indicators of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of buildings were factors that have prominent influence on the urban thermal environment. The interaction of mean DEM respectively with building density, volume ratio, mean building height, and mean building volume demonstrated significant effects on both LST and AT, and the analysis of variance results of these indicators with each temperature reached a significance level of {$\leq$}0.05. The types and levels of the main strongly correlated indicators varied with increasing temperature levels. The optimal combination of levels corresponding to the lower LST depended on the terrain, while the lower AT was affected by a combination of buildings and terrain. The height indicators contributed more to LST than to AT. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Land surface temperature data was taken from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of UHI in Wuhan during 2001 2018 and, the UHI intensity changes of built-up land in 13 administrative regions in Wuhan were analyzed. Furthermore, 34 spatial error models and 34 ordinary least squares models were established and compared. Spatial error models showed good fitting effect, which were used to determine the influence of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index (NDBI), and social--economic factors (population and nighttime light) on UHI intensity in central urban area and new urban area. The explanatory power changes of these four indicators during 2001 2018 were explored as well. The average UHI intensity in 2014 2018 has increased by about 0.45 {$^\circ$}C compared to that in 2001 2005. NDBI is the most dominant factor contributing to the increase in temperature. The impact of NDVI on UHI intensity changes from negative to positive, and the impact of NDBI on UHI intensity in central urban area is weakened during 2001--2018. Social--economic factors have a greater impact on new urban area than on central urban area. These findings show the effects and the explanatory power changes of driving factors during 18 years, which can provide a better understanding of the formation and development of UHI and support for the future urban planning of Wuhan. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

We sampled five urban parks and five seafront promenade parks twelve times each over two years. Measurement data revealed that green spaces had lower air temperature (Ta) than urban areas, especially at night, with a cooling effect of 0.17 {$^\circ$}C to 0.88 {$^\circ$}C. Blue spaces had higher Ta than urban areas in the day, but lower Ta at night. The average warming effect is 0.42 {$^\circ$}C among five measured blue spaces in the morning. Using Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) as an indicator for heat stress, the benefit of green spaces in relieving heat stress is smaller than that of Ta because of the increase in relative humidity. Due to the exposure to radiation, open seafront places have stronger heat stress than nearby urban areas. Mixed green-blue spaces along the measurement paths had no extra cooling effect and thermal benefit compared to green/blue spaces, while trees could yield substantial additional cooling effects. The correlation analysis also proves that the thermal environment is positively related to the urban greenness level and negatively related to impervious areas. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

In recent years, with the development of social civilisation and the influence of COVID-19, people have become increasingly interested in the quality of hospitals in their living environment. This makes medical convenience (hospital accessibility) a crucial element in determining housing prices. At the same time, people regard rail as one of the important means to access hospitals. Therefore, demonstrating the intrinsic value of accessibility to hospitals and rail in residential areas is essential. As a point of reference, this paper presents an empirical analysis of Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China, a city in a developing nation with relatively widespread access to hospitals during a significant rail construction period. The study demonstrates the interaction between hospital and rail accessibility and their moderate influence on housing prices, which is geographically heterogeneous. The study also determines the optimal metric model for assessing geographical interaction based on the significance and stability of the interaction in geographic space. It concludes with a discussion of the findings and social recommendations.},

  abstract = {Context: Surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) is a classical measure depicting urban heat island phenomenon via remotely sensed thermal infrared data. The most common approach is to compare urban and rural land surface temperatures (LST), which is not only sensitive to the selection of pixels/measurements representative of urban and rural areas, but also overlook the pixel-level intra-city SUHII variation and thermodynamics associated with heterogeneous urban landscape. Objectives: This study develops a new SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} , via pixel-based sharpening enhancement method to integrate a pixel's LST magnitude that reflects a city's overall thermal context with its local SUHII that takes the landscape variations and cognate thermal interactions with neighboring pixels into account. Methods: Using Guangzhou (south China) as a case study, SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} is constructed applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST product for the summer season of 2015 through cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. The effectiveness of SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} is tested by comparing SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} results (based on 3 {\texttimes} 3, 5 {\texttimes} 5 and 7 {\texttimes} 7 kernels) with the original LST, a two-dimensional Gaussian surface, and Gaussian density curve with stepwise increments of the thermal influence from neighboring pixels on the center pixels. Results: We found that (1) local SUHII variations are sensitive to the spatial composition of a center pixel's land use type and that of its eight neighbors; (2) SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} makes more pronounced those spots that are not only heat per se (with higher original LST), but also receive additional heat load emitted from directly adjacent pixels due to land use homogeneity; (3) the effectiveness of SUHIIen {\textasciicircum} could be successfully verified. Conclusions: This new SUHI indicator accounts for inter-pixel spatial variation of UHI and highlights how neighboring pixels' homogeneous/heterogeneous land use and associated thermal properties could affect center pixels' thermal characteristics via either reinforcement or mitigation of heat load. It contributes to rigorous assessment of potential heat risks at micro-pixel scale and tailored design of mitigation strategies. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

As an important representation of the UHI effect and the urban thermal environment, it is critical to investigate the importance of evaluating urban spatial form (USF) indicators on land surface temperature (LST) to alleviate urban thermal environment prob-lems. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the importance of USF indicators from three perspectives: landscape pattern, building morphology, and social development, on LST at 10 grid scales in the main area of Xi'an City, using the XGBoost model. The results showed that: (1) LST was similar in spring and autumn, but significantly lower in winter. The distribution of high-temperature areas in the four seasons has its own characteristics, but the low-temperature areas are mainly distributed in the water bodies and parks in the north and south of the middle of the study area, which are less affected by the seasons. (2) Mean architecture height (MAH) is a seasonal stable factor with a cooling effect. The relationship between patch density (PD), landscape shape index (LSI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), contagion index (CONTAG), people density (POD), floor area ratio (FAR) and LST varies with seasons. The correlation between building density (BD) and LST is complex. (3) The degree of influence of the USF indicators on seasonal LST could be ranked in the following order: building morphology {\textquestiondown} landscape pattern {\textquestiondown} social development. (4) The appropriate size to study the relationship between USF and seasonal LST is 60 m. The highest contribution of USF to LST is building morphology, three indicators affect 43},

Furthermore, by constructing a system of urban spatial structure indicators and adopting methods such as correlation coefficient analysis and spatial econometric modeling, the factors influencing UHI were further revealed. The results showed that (1) There was spatial heterogeneity of the UHI in the central urban area of Jinan. The High-High cluster was mainly distributed in the north of the central urban area of Jinan; the Low-Low cluster was primarily distributed in the south of the central urban area of Jinan and the waters. Agglomeration distribution approximately coincided with heat island distribution. (2) The correlations between urban spatial structure indicators and LST in different dimensions were generally high and varied significantly. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional indicators all showed a highly significant positive relationship with LST. The mean and standard deviation of the DEM and absolute building height in the one-dimensional indicators were both negatively and significantly correlated with LST. (3) Building height standard deviation had a significantly positive spillover effect on the LST of the neighboring areas; this spillover effect was greater than the direct effect on these regions. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Water carrying capacity is a vital part of the carrying capacity of various natural resources in the sustainable development of a region. Appropriately assessing water environment carrying capacity (WECC) is crucial for wise water resources management and economic and social progress advancement. This study developed a WECC evaluation index system for Suzhou, a representative city in southeastern China facing water quality challenges, with the city being an example to study the WECC in the Yangtze River Delta region. By employing principal component analysis (PCA), 20 WECC-related variables were selected from the water and environment, human society, and socio-economic system as the local WECC evaluation indicators. These indicators were weighted by PCA analysis and the entropy method, resulting in overall scores. Evaluating the data from 2001 to 2021, this study showed that the overall WECC score has increased over time. Factors such as rapid urbanization, population growth, economic and social development, and a shortage of water supply have strained the WECC in Suzhou. As an important industrial development zone in the Yangtze River Delta, the city faces significant environmental pollution and water resources problems. The results show that the primary influencing factors are total water resources, surface water resources, water consumption, urbanization rate, water consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP, industrial value-added water consumption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions of GDP. The findings of this study help to plan the city's future development and thereby contribute to urban sustainability.}

Meanwhile, the microclimate model ENVI-met BioMet (V4) was used for predicting the effect different design options on outdoor thermal comfort using PET, and the Stormwater Runoff Test (SRT) is also calculated by the academic Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) for Autodesk Infraworks 360 software. The results present as the prediction function of the eco-efficiency of the outdoor environmental design. Research suggests that pervious paving materials are broadly capable of lowering temperatures and improving human thermal comfort, and when integrated with trees have potential to meet eco-efficiency objectives. Moreover, the models can be used as the useful guideline for outdoor environmental design to toward the eco-friendly for urban residents' outdoor living of mixed-use real estate development in Bangkok, Thailand. {\copyright} 2019, Faculty of Architecture and Planning Thammasat University.

This study takes the Olympic Park in Beijing as an example and combines remote sensing data with measured data from meteorological stations to propose a new method for evaluating the urban cold island effect based on the superposition of multiple remote sensing images. The research results show that: The magnitude of PCI(Park Cold Island)values has a highly significant correlation with the highest temperature of the day, and the two show a linear correlation. The higher the temperature, the greater the PCI; From 2013 to 2021, the difference between the highest temperature and the lowest temperature in the study area is 23 times, and the difference between the maximum and minimum PCI value is 19 times. The PCImix assessment method can better contain the extreme value, reduce the instability of temperature with seasonal changes and the impact of temperature variation differences between years, and reduce the contingency of assessment research; This new method is systematic, continuous, and statistically significant. The method proposed in this study for evaluating the urban cold island effect based on multi-phase image overlay can provide guidance for the future construction of urban parks and open up new ideas for evaluating the cooling effect of urban parks. {\copyright} 2024},

Therefore, reducing the vulnerability of the systems through physical and organizational restoration plans are the main concern for system engineers and utility managers that are responsible for the design, operation, and protection of WDNs. In this paper, a resilience index (R) of a WDN has been proposed that is the product of three indices: (1)the number of users temporarily without water, (2)the water level in the tank, and (3)the water quality. The resilience index is expected to help planners and engineers evaluate the functionality of a WDN, which includes: (1)delivering a certain demand of water with an acceptable level of pressure and quality, and (2)the restoration process following an extreme event. A small town in the south of Italy has been selected as a case study to show the applicability of this index using different disruptive scenarios and restoration plans. The numerical results show the importance of the partition of the network into districts to reduce the lack of services. It is also necessary to consider the indices separately to find trends that cannot be captured by the global index. Advantages and disadvantages of the different restoration plans are discussed. The proposed indices can be implemented in a decision support tool used by governmental agencies that want to include the restoration process, and the environmental and social aspects in their design procedure.},

  abstract = {Dual water systems are becoming an important urban water management strategy as more utilities adopt increasingly integrated approaches that enable matching source water quality to the intended use, more efficient use of resources, use of nontraditional local water sources, and more resilient systems. Four alternative strategies for the dual supply of raw water for nonpotable municipal uses (e.g.,landscape irrigation and fire supply) and treated water for potable uses were evaluated in this study. The alternative strategies included centralized and decentralized water treatment approaches, varying distribution system scales, and integration of existing irrigation ditches with raw water landscape irrigation systems. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to conduct a triple bottom line (TBL) evaluation of the alternative strategies versus maintaining a conventional water supply system. This methodology allowed for the inclusion of incommensurable performance indicators and stakeholder preferences in the decision process, which was instrumental in garnering stakeholder support. The study found that the alternative strategies provide many social and environmental benefits versus a conventional system that may justify initial capital costs; a predominately gravity-fed distribution system favored centralized water treatment alternatives to decentralized options, existing irrigation canals for municipal use provide unique social and environmental benefits important to the community, and the optimum strategies are dependent on local conditions and community priorities.}

To test this effect, this paper presents the results of an analysis based on Hedonic Linear Regression, Spatial Hedonic Linear Regression and Hedonic Geographically Weighted Regression models, carried out for the study case of the province of Taranto (Italy). The biggest steel factory in Europe is located here, and some population movements have been observed in relation to the high levels of pollution in the areas close to the factory. The variables used to measure the impact of externalities are of two types: objective indicators such as the distance from the industrial area and the levels of NO2 and PM10, and subjective indicators such as the level of pollution and noise perceived by the population. Results show that the distance from factory was a positive factor in the real estate prices although not always clearly significant, and among pollution indicators, only high levels of NO2 had a negative effect. The accessibility to employment did not prove to be a significant variable in the real estate prices, which indicates that factors related to environmental quality have a greater weight in residential location. Moreover, models including subjective indicators do not show better estimates than models considering only objective indicators. Finally, spatial regression models were useful to analyse the spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity observed in the data. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper analyzes how the spatial accessibility to local public services is distributed equitably among different social and economic groups in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (MR), Chile. To accomplish this objective, I use accessibility measures to local public services such as transportation, public education, healthcare, kindergartens, parks, fire and police stations, cultural infrastructure, and information about housing prices and exempted housing units from local taxes by block, as well as quantile regressions and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). The main results confirm the accessibility to local public services is unequally distributed among residents. However, it affects more low-income groups who are suffering from significant deficits in the provision of local public services. In this scenario, poor residents face a double disadvantage due to their social exclusion from urban systems and their limited access to essential services such as education, healthcare, or transportation. In particular, I found that social residential segregation might be reinforced by insufficient access to local infrastructure that the most impoverished population should assume.},

  abstract = {In our current global warming climate, the growth of record-breaking heat waves (HWs) is expected to increase in its frequency and intensity. Consequently, the considerably growing and agglomerated world's urban population becomes more exposed to serious heat-related health risks. In this context, the study of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity during HWs is of substantial importance due to the potential vulnerability urbanized areas might have to HWs in comparison to their surrounding rural areas. This article discusses Land Surface Temperatures (LST) reached during the extreme HW over Western North America during the boreal summer of 2021 using Thermal InfraRed (TIR) imagery acquired from TIR Sensor (TIRS) (30 m spatial resolution) onboard Landsat-8 platform and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (1 km spatial resolution) onboard Terra/Aqua platforms. We provide an early assessment of maximum LSTs reached over the affected areas, as well as impacts in terms of SUHI over the main cities and towns. MODIS series of LST from 2000 to 2021 over urbanized areas presented the highest recorded LST values in late June 2021, with maximum values around 50{\textopenbullet} C for some cities. High spatial resolution LSTs (Landsat-8) were used to map SUHI intensity as well as to assess the impact of SUHI on thermal comfort conditions at intraurban space by means of a thermal environmental quality indicator, the Urban Field Thermal Variance Index (UFTVI). The same high resolution LSTs were used to verify the existence of clusters and employ a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) to quantify its degree of strength. We identified the spatial distribution of heat patterns within the intraurban space as well as described its behavior across the thermal landscape by fitting a polynomial regression model. We also qualitatively analyze the relationship between both UFTVI and LST clusters with different land cover types. Findings indicate that average daytime SUHI intensity for the studied cities was typically within 1 to 5{\textopenbullet} C, with some exceptional values surpassing 7{\textopenbullet} C and 9{\textopenbullet} C. During night, the SUHI intensity was reduced to variations within 1--3{\textopenbullet} C, with a maximum value of +4{\textopenbullet} C. The extreme LSTs recorded indicate no significant influence of HW on SUHI intensity. SUHI intensity maps of the intraurban space evidence hotspots of much higher values located at densely built-up areas, while urban green spaces and dense vegetation show lower values. In the same manner, UTFVI has shown ``no'' SUHI for densely vegetated regions, water bodies, and low-dense built-up areas with intertwined dense vegetation, while the ``strongest'' SUHI was observed for non-vegetated dense built-up areas with low albedo material such as concrete and pavement. LST was evidenced as a good marker for assessing the influence of HWs on SUHI and recognizing potential thermal environmental consequences of SUHI intensity. This finding highlights that remote-sensing based LST is particularly suitable as an indicator in the analysis of SUHI intensity patterns during HWs at different spatial resolutions. LST used as an indicator for analyzing and detecting extreme temperature events and its consequences seems to be a promising means for rapid and accurate monitoring and mapping. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The author analyses data from about 500,000 respondents from over 140 countries and uses both descriptive statistics as well as regression analysis (using a random effects within between model [Bell et al., 2019]). Findings: The findings show that concerns about housing affordability are widespread both within and across countries but the extent of these concerns depends greatly on the country, the subgroup and the indicator analysed. Moreover, in many countries, more people worry about other aspects of life than about housing affordability. Research limitations/implications: The global diversity in the housing affordability crisis suggests that one should be cautious when extrapolating research findings for a given country to other countries or when proposing housing policy transfer across countries. Practical implications: The specific nature of the housing affordability crisis varies substantially across countries. Policymakers thus should be aware that there is no guarantee that a housing affordability policy that was effective in one country will also be effective in another country. Originality/value: This paper is original in its use of the Gallup World poll, a unique survey, which is done world-wide and hence is ideally suited for the purpose of this paper, providing a much more detailed picture of the global housing crisis than so far available in the literature. {\copyright} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to show that the combined use of the resilience index (Todini, 2000) with a loop based diameter uniformity index (here formulated) yields a good indirect reliability measure, which can be conveniently used within the optimization processes of the water distribution system design. The methodology adopted to show the advantages of the combined use of the two indexes consists of (a) a three-objective optimization performed in order to simultaneously minimize costs (first objective function) and maximize both the resilience and the loop diameter uniformity indexes (second and third objective functions respectively); (b) a retrospective assessment of performance indicators relative to critical operational scenarios on the solutions of the Pareto surface obtained at the end of the optimization process. Applications were performed considering a simple case study, which made it possible to easily compare the new approach, based on a three-objective optimization, with the two-objective optimization process based on the use of the resilience index alone and also with the two-objective optimization process based on the modified resilience index formulated by Prasad, Sung-Hoon, and Namsik (2003) (where the diameter uniformity is defined at nodal level and inserted as a weight in Todini's resilience index), being both indexes a surrogate to reliability. The comparison pointed out that using resilience and loop diameter uniformity as two separate objective functions in an optimization process leads to solutions which perform better during critical operational scenarios (particularly when dealing with segment isolation) than the equally expensive solutions obtained adopting the resilience index (independently of its formulation) alone as reliability related objective function. Since the proposed approach suggests that a three-objective optimization be utilized to perform an appropriate pipe-network optimal design, an improvement in the well-known NSGA-II algorithm (Deb, Pratap, Agarwal, \& Meyarivan, 2002) is proposed as its original formulation proved to have some difficulties dealing with more than two objectives. {\copyright} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

This research aims to develop measurement and evaluation tools for SWC key performance indicators (KPIs), focusing on innovative water technologies in establishing unified global standards and certification schemes. The KPIs are categorized based on the stage at which water is being measured, namely the urban water cycle, water disaster management and water supply and treatment. The objective is to assess cities' use of technologies in providing sufficient water supply, monitoring water quality, strengthening disaster resilience and maintaining and preserving the urban water ecosystem. The assessment is composed of a variety of procedures performed in a quantitative and qualitative manner, the details of which are presented in this study. The developed SWC KPI measurements are used to evaluate the urban water management practices for Busan Eco Delta City, located in Busan, South Korea. Evaluation processes were presented and established, serving as the guideline basis for certification in analyzing future cities, providing integrated and comprehensive information on the status of their urban water system, gathering new techniques, and proposing solutions for smarter measures. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

To this end, a kharkhona was designed, built and evaluated in an open urban space. Physiological equivalent temperature index, which has been shown to be highly associated with the sensation of thermal comfort, was used as the indicator for evaluation of outdoor thermal condition. The findings showed that kharkhona can reduce the PET index by 9.34 degrees C in the space inside kharkhona compared to the environment outside the construct and moderate the "hot" and "very hot" heat sensation of the space outside kharkhona to "warm" and "slightly warm" in the inner space of the construct. Kharkhona can be used as a reference model for designing natural ventilation and is a viable strategy for modification of outdoor thermal comfort since it can provide better comfort conditions than vegetation.},

This paper aimed to identify the most important variables driving urban water supply patterns in China, a region which has seen rapid urban growth in the last few decades. In addition, a principal component analysis-informed urban water sustainability index was developed in order to benchmark cities. The research involved applying statistical learning and other analytical methods to 12 years of urban water supply data for 627 cities across China. The findings were as follows: (1) PCA showed that approximately 46.8\% of variability in the data could be explained by two principal components. Component 1 (37.26\%) was more closely associated with variables related to water supply and sale, supply pipelines, and water supply finance. C2 (9.51\%) was clearly related to urban water prices and average per capita water use. (2) Random forest and XGBoost algorithms were effective in classifying cities according to their region, with model testing accuracies of 87.69\% and 88.32\% respectively. (3) Chinese cities have consistently suffered water loss/leakage rates above 20\% since 2001, and water prices are closely associated with leakage. (4) China's urban water sustainability has increased by just 3.56\% between 2001 and 2013; Southwest China saw the highest growth rate in urban water supply sustainability. The implications of our research effort will be useful for decision makers in water-stressed urban areas around the world who are seeking novel insights in how to leverage statistical learning techniques to gain insights into urban drinking water supply patterns. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd}

Based on this conceptual framework, 35 indicators were selected to establish an urban water security evaluation index system. In order to solve the problem of randomness and fuzziness of the boundary values of urban water security classification levels, the cloud matter element model was applied. Chongqing was used as an example for verification, and the results showed that the water security status of Chongqing City improved from 2011 (V) to 2019 (II). This indicates that the water ecology restoration project, centralized water source protection project, centralized water supply project, water-saving society transformation, and flood and drought prevention system construction project implemented in Chongqing has achieved significant results. However, Chongqing still faces the problem that the construction of an urban flood control system cannot meet the speed of urban development. The government should slow down the urbanization and allow the urban flood control system to be ready before the area is occupied. In addition, the awareness of water conservation for industrial use in Chongqing has been formed, and citizens' awareness of water conservation for domestic use should be enhanced in the future.},

However, the impacts of urban expansion on climate and heat stress for such a city with complex physiographic background (land-water mosaics) remain understudied. Using a coupled urban-lake-atmospheric model, we first examined summer climate responses to urban expansion and lake shrinkage in Wuhan during 2000--2020. Second, multiple heat stress indicators were used to evaluate human thermal comfort in different contexts of interest. Results showed that the presence of water bodies reduced daytime maximum temperature, raised nighttime minimum temperature, and increased moisture content in urban and built-up areas. Urban expansion alone led to summer warming of 0.9{$^\circ$}C and drying of 0.9 g/kg, with local peak warming and drying up to 2{$^\circ$}C and 1.4 g/kg. In comparison, urban expansion with lake shrinkage showed a reduced magnitude of warming of 0.8{$^\circ$}C and increased magnitude of drying of 1.6 g/kg, with the maximum changes up to 1.4{$^\circ$}C and 2.0 g/kg. The presence of water bodies reduced while urban expansion increased the frequency of occurrence of yellow and orange heat alert days; however, both increased the number of days exerting high thermal risks on outdoor workers and those days that were dangerous for outdoor pedestrians. Our study underlined that both urban expansion and water body existence exerted a strong influence on summer climate and heat stress in Wuhan, and highlighted that mitigation measures should be taken to alleviate the deleterious impacts of high temperature and humidity on human health. {\copyright} 2022.

This is done using air temperature data gathered in the Antwerp (Belgium) area in July 2013, in an experimental set-up composed of an urban and a nearby rural climate station, each equipped with both actively and passively ventilated temperature sensors. The resulting data shows an air temperature bias between the passively and actively ventilated measurements of up to approximately 2 °C, the highest values occurring under conditions of a high solar radiation load and low wind speed. Yet, the canopy urban heat island (UHI) increment, i.e., the urban-rural air temperature difference, is hardly affected by the ventilation method, which is ascribed to the fact that high UHI increments occur mainly at night when, in absence of solar radiation, active ventilation has a lesser influence on measured temperature. Conversely, urban heat indicators involving daytime air temperature, such as heatwave degree days (HWDD) or Steadman's apparent temperature, tend to produce overly high values when use is made of passively ventilated temperature measurements. © 2023},

To contribute to the improvement of urban comfort, this work presents an experimental methodological proposal for the analysis and multicriteria optimization of performance indicators using a parametric workflow through Grasshopper. This workflow can lead to the development of a set of environmental design criteria as support tools in the design of the urban configuration. The methodology is based on the quantification of two parameters on the analysis and management of daylight in interior spaces by means of dynamic metrics and, on the other hand, on the evaluation of hygrothermal conditions and the urban heat island effect, which affect both the daytime comfort of passersby and the nighttime comfort of dwellings. This study considers the most typical variables of urban layout, both morphological and material. The case study analyzed is located in the city of Seville (Spain), which has a significant percentage of its contemporary buildings without a suitable adaptation to local climate conditions. The results obtained from the case study prove the potential of the proposed methodology to evaluate and optimize lighting and thermal performance at the neighbourhood scale. Thus, it provides urban planners with a powerful decision support tool for both urban expansion and urban renewal. {\copyright} 2021,Journal of Engineering Research.All Rights Reserved},

Besides quantitative data collection, the study also survey residents in high heat risk areas to acquire insights into their current experiences and perceptions heat. The results reveal that individuals in high SUHI areas experience discomfort across varying temperature ranges, influenced by particular working conditions and personal characteristics. Moreover, the findings highlight a significant correlation between LST and Tair, reaching a coefficient of 0.73, indicating the applicability of land surface temperature in large-scale temperature calculations.

To be able to manage heatwaves and quantify the impacts on human health, it is crucial to define them and implement policy preventive measures. However, heatwaves are relative to the climate of a location: The same meteorological conditions can constitute a heatwave in one place but not in another. Due to different climatic con-ditions, social characteristics, and adaptation, heatwaves should be defined on a local scale, which poses difficulties when it comes to comparison of different definitions. The aim of the present study is to define heatwaves, implementing robust statistical analysis for three different indicators (tem-perature, physiological equivalent temperature (PET), and universal thermal climate index (UTCI)) for three causes of mortality (i.e., cardiological and respiratory mortality and cardiorespiratory mor-tality) using Attica (Greece) as a case study. Our results define a heatwave for Attica as a period of at least 3 days when the mean temperature is higher than the 97.5th percentile. Afterwards, we encapsulate the harvesting effect by implementing robust statistical analysis, using the Superposed Epoch analysis. Consequently, quantifying heatwaves is crucial so as to create early warning systems and prevent avoidable mortality. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This study which was conducted in 2018 evaluated the level of satisfaction in terms building features in six completed and occupied housing estates in Benin city, namely the federal owned estate at Ikpoba hill, and state owned housing estates located at Ugbowo, Oregbeni, Oluku, Evboriaria and Iyekogba. Data were collected from 1000 heads of households and analysed using descriptive statistical tools, categorical regression and factor analyses. The findings showed that the building features significantly affect the level of resident's satisfaction. The RSI scores for the relatively old estates; EDPA, Ikpoba hill and Oregbeni and are on the dissatisfied region (RSI: 1.1-2.00) while for the relatively newer ones; Andrew Wilson and Oluku, the RSI scores are on the satisfied level (RSI=. 3.1-4.00) with building features features. The study recommends that the design for future low cost housing should consider the family sizes of average Nigerian family, kitchen design that make use of cooking gas, kerosene and outdoor kitchen possible. The paper concludes that the buildings should maintain an acceptable quality standard in terms of functional spaces, structural stability and aesthetics as this will result to resident's housing satisfaction. {\copyright} 2019 Kingsley Okechukwu Dimuna et al., published by Sciendo 2019.},

Then, we conducted multiple robustness tests, all of which corroborated the benchmark results' reliability. Finally, deeper than existing research, the mechanism of the impact of urban housing prices on the consumption structure upgrading was further explored and it was found that increasing urban housing prices can affect consumption structure upgrading by affecting residents' marginal propensity to consume in development and enjoyment. Our find-ings provide key alternatives for China's government to promote residents' consumption structure upgrading. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Given the sharp and persistent increase in both house prices and rents, the need to increase housing supply in the Irish market has become increasingly pressing over the last number of years. While a number of Government policy initiatives have been introduced, it is clear that actual levels of housing supply are still somewhat below the level of demand, with official Government targets suggesting a significant difference between the two. Given the difficulties experienced by the supply side of the domestic housing market, it is informative and interesting to contrast housing supply in the Irish market with that of Ireland's nearest housing markets; in particular, the Northern Irish, English, Scottish and Welsh markets. These markets share many of the characteristics of the Irish market in terms of planning and regulatory regimes as well as cultural preferences for certain property types compared with continental housing markets. In this paper we, therefore, build on previous work by Egan and McQuinn (2023a) to assess the relationship between house prices and supply levels across the different Irish and UK markets. This serves as an important benchmark by which to evaluate the performance of the supply side of the Irish residential market. {\copyright} 2024, Economic and Social Studies. All rights reserved.},

An input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) was improved to benchmark the relative sustain ability of the water infrastructure of 157 cities in China The DEA calculates a single sustainability score using seven inputs and five outputs that represent the economic, resource and environmental dimehsions of sustainability. Overall, 69 out of the 157 sampled systems obtained high sustainability scores. Eight specific efficiency indicators based on individual DEA input to output ratio were evaluated to identify the causes of performance differences. Compared to water supply systems, the performance of wastewater treatment plants has greater influence on the sustainability score of the overall system. For all systems, the sustainability scores are more sensitive to sludge production and electricity consumption than capital investment and removal efficiency of treatment processes. The DEA provides guidelines to cities for setting priorities in order to meet specific sustainability criteria. Statistical analysis indicates that the overall sustainability score primarily depends on the system scale, meteorological conditions such as air temperature and rainfall, and source water quality.

The management of water resources is directly related to the needs of urban residents' lives and the area's socio-economic development. How to determine the effective evaluation indicators and methods is an important prerequisite to solving the water resource security problem. This study took Luoyang City as the research area and constructed a water resource security evaluation index system based on pressure-state-response framework. An analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method were used to determine the index weight. A set pair analysis model was then introduced to evaluate the security of water resources in Luoyang from 2006 to 2016. The results of this study show that the standard of water resource security generally improved in Luoyang in the latter years of the study period. From 2006 to 2008, Luoyang was graded at the Insecurity Level. This compares to a slightly improved grading of Critical Security Level from 2009 to 2016 (except for 2013). However, the overall grade is still low. The pressure on the Luoyang water resource system mainly comes from the development of the urban socio-economy, which in turn has caused problems for both the quantity and quality of water resources. Therefore, a series of countermeasures have been introduced as a means of improving the water resource security of Luoyang, and these measures have achieved certain results. However, further improvements to the efficiency of water resource utilization and strengthening the management and protection of water resources remain necessary. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

However, traditional urban thermal environment assessments typically relied on simple linear integration of associated indicators, often neglecting the spatial interaction effect. To explore the spatial interaction among the three elements, this study proposes an accessibility-based urban thermal environment assessment framework. Using Zhengzhou, a rapidly urbanizing city, as an example, remotely sensed images from three periods (2010, 2015 and 2020) were applied to extract urban green space (UGS) and hot island area (HIA). An improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and bivariate local Moran's I were employed to explore whether residents' clustering locations are more likely to access cooling service or to be exposed to heat risk. The results demonstrate that the UGS in the city has been expanding, whereas the HIA shrank within the inner city in 2015 and then increased in 2020. Even though the urban thermal environment may have improved in the last decade, the spatial interaction among the residents, cooling service and heat risk area could be exacerbated. Spatial autocorrelation shows an increase in locations that are disadvantageous for resident congregation. Even when sufficient cooling services were provided, residents in these areas could still be exposed to high heat risk. The developed urban thermal environment framework provides a novel insight into the residents' heat risk exposure and cooling service accessibility, and the findings could assist urban planners in targeting the improvement of extra heat exposure risk locations. {\copyright} 2024},

However, the practicality of GI retrofitting is often neglected in traditional GI planning, which tends to focus mainly on the benefits of GI. In this study, we spatially quantify regional states from six aspects, including stormwater management, air quality, access to green space, urban heat island effect, habitat quality and development level on 1km2 grids. While the first five indicators represent the benefits of GI, the last indicator represents the opportunity cost for GI retrofitting. These regional states are treated as driving factors to sway overall GI planning and are further integrated for synergy and trade-off analysis, priority ranking and grids clustering. The results reveal significant spatial unevenness of regional states, which indicates the necessity for targeted GI planning. The spatial pattern of synergy and priority ranking suggests that the city center in the eastern bank of the river should be prioritized for GI intervention. Adaptive GI strategies are proposed based on the results of grids clustering. The developed approach could be conducive for decision makers in implementing targeted GI planning for responding to spatial unevenness.},

Indicators reflecting the influence of socioeconomic aspects in these cities and the lagged values of housing prices, acting as so-called anchors in this model, were used as the independent variables. The results obtained from this analysis indicate that it is the lagged prices of housing that have the strongest influence on the formation of price levels in the market. The study confirms the presence of the so-called price anchoring effect, which can be understood as the tendency of market participants to accept prices at levels that can be justified not only by socio-economic factors, but also by the price levels established in their minds. The main purpose of the research presented here is to show that there is no close relationship between quoted housing prices and their objective factors. The quality of models reflecting these relationships clearly improves when lagged housing prices are introduced as the explanatory variables, which may confirm the price anchoring effect derived from behavioral economics, meaning that the heuristics of anchoring and adjustment can be applied to the analysis of the behavior of a collective of individuals - many market participants. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s)},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate housing affordability of urban residents in Northwest China. Moreover, this paper attempts to understand the consistency and influencing factors of various indicators on the evaluation of housing affordability. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses multiyear data on house sales, residents' incomes and living expenses from 2011 to 2022. House price-to-income ratio, housing affordability index and residual income approach were calculated by using these data and used as the measure of housing affordability. Findings: The results show that there are obvious differences in the housing affordability among the Xi'an, Lanzhou and Yinchuan during 2011--2022, and the housing affordability of residents in cities with small population and economic scale is better. The ability of most urban residents to afford suitable housing is still poor, and the ability to afford small-sized housing is better. Most families with below-middle income have poor housing affordability. It is also observed that although various indicators had similarities in the evaluation of residents' housing affordability, the comprehensive evaluation results of multiple indicators were more reliable. Social implications: The research results provide a basis for the decision-making of the government's urban housing policy and improvement of residents' housing conditions. Originality/value: The results have a clear understanding of the housing affordability of urban residents in Northwest China. The study found that the geographical location and topography of the city is also a factor affecting the housing affordability. {\copyright} 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The framework long relied, however, on a rickety and complicated conveyor belt for converting regional housing targets into actual production. Superintending the conveyor belt was an administrative entity, the Department of Housing and Community Development, whose rules had no legal effect, and whose judgments about the adequacy of a local government's housing plan received virtually no deference from the courts. This Article contends that the Department's position has been fundamentally transformed by a series of individually modest but complementary bills enacted from 2017 to 2019. The Department now has authority to strengthen, simplify, and supplement the conveyor belt in ways that would have been (legally speaking) unimaginable just a few years ago. More specifically, the Department may (1) adopt an ``expected yield'' definition of site capacity, which would more than double the amount of nominal zoned capacity that local governments must provide; (2) promulgate metrics and standards for whether the supply of housing within a local government's territory is substantially constrained; and (3) insist, as a condition of housing-plan approval, that poorly performing local governments adopt major, substantive reforms to local development processes, regulations, and fees. Though it's doubtful that the Department could mandate particular constraint-mitigation measures, such as ministerial permitting, the Department may incentivize their adoption by announcing compliance safe harbors.

The framework serves as means to guide public policy makers in establishing policies and guidelines for enhancing municipal capacity in project management in the context of infrastructure assets. It also can help municipalities in defining gaps and areas of improvement. The framework is not intended to be universal.

Increasing attention is being paid to the thermal comfort of open spaces by both designers and researchers. Nature-based solutions and man-made devices to improve the comfort of outdoor spaces during summer are spreading, but effective, easy simulation and design support tools for this purpose are still lacking, as most of the available software such as ENVI-met or RayMan cannot model such devices. As Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) is one of the most relevant and comprehensive indicators of Outdoor Thermal Comfort (OTC), this study aims to investigate PET variations of different artificial shading systems and propose a simplified methodology for assessing them through analytical simulations with RayMan software. When modeling the shading elements, the trick adopted for this purpose is to associate different cloud densities with the shading provided by the screens, thus overcoming a gap that affects the software. The procedure is digitally tested in a covered courtyard case study in Bologna (Italy). Diverse options proposed by the designers for textile screening materials have been compared, showing that these reduce by at least 1 degree celsius the PET-gauged thermal stress. Beyond specific results, the main outcome of this study is the procedure developed to simulate sun-shading sail effects on OTC by means of RayMan, which can support designers in planning effective solutions for open space livability in summertime.},

  abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a vital satellite remote sensing-driven indicator of earth heat studies. LST can provide information about urban heat emission, urban climate, and human activities in urban areas. In recent years, the calculated LST for a satellite image pixel has been studied as a parameter affected by urban environment factors such as available land cover types in the same pixel. However, in this study, a scenario in which the calculated LST for a pixel is not only affected by the factors in the same pixel but also by the factors in the neighbor pixels is studied. Firstly, required maps for the calculated LST and influential factors (indicators of vegetation, building, and water surfaces) are produced from satellite remote sensing images. Secondly, the relationship between the LST and influential factors is modeled using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model. Thirdly, Moran's I and Lagrange Multiplier tests are used to analyze the existence of spatial dependency and correlation in residuals of the OLS model. Fourthly, three spatial regression models (Spatially Lagged X (SLX), Spatial Lag (SL), and Spatial Error (SE) models) are used to model the spatial dependency and correlation between the LST and influential factors. Finally, the outcomes of the models are compared and evaluated. Results present related maps for the variables besides maps for spatial residuals in the spatial regression models. The outcomes of the models are investigated by p-values, log-likelihood, and RMSE. To conclude, the spatial regression models fitted the relation between the dependent and independent variables better than the OLS model. {\copyright} The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Societ{\`a} Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET) 2024.},

We confirm the presence of a financial cycle in South Africa that has a longer duration and a larger amplitude than the traditional business cycle. Developments in measures of credit and house prices are important indicators of the financial cycle, although the case for including equity prices in the measures is less certain.

However, the detailed quantification of spatial relationships between blue and green infrastructure elements has not been conducted about the thermal environment. To study the synergistic effect of water and vegetation, this paper conducted the field measurement and questionnaire on typical UBGI in Tianjin, China. The spatial characteristics and the current situation of the thermal environment of UBGI were obtained, and the thermal demands of UBGI users were established based on the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and heat index (HI). The results of the study indicated that the synergistic effect of the water body and vegetation was the most significant at a distance of 6 m from the water body. In the condition of light airflow (wind speed \& LE;1.5 m/s), the different orientations relative to the water body had no significant difference in the thermal environment. Based on the quantification of spatial relationships, the conversion factors (cT and cRH) of the synergistic effect at different locations in UBGI were obtained. Furthermore, synergistic effect (SE) models of the thermal environment of UBGI were established according to the conversion factors. Meanwhile, the thermal comfort benchmarks for SE models were quantified (WBGT: 25.76-27.96 degrees C and HI: 24.98-27.25 degrees C). This study provides scientific guidance and reference for the planning and redevelopment of UBGI.},

As such, long-term management strategies need to improve the resilience of water supply systems and account for the sustainability of water withdrawals. In this context, metabolic modelling may provide a support to decision-making in the medium-long term, based on sustainability criteria. This approach enables mimicking a water supply network (WSN) based on a set of material and energy fluxes that interact and influence each other. By analyzing these fluxes, a suite of key performance indicators (KPIs) is evaluated in order to identify which kind of interventions may be applied to increase the sustainability of the system. Here, we apply a metabolic model,WaterMet2, to a WSN in the Reggio Emilia Province (Italy), combined with hydraulic simulations conducted with EPANET. Different alternative strategies are compared, including a reduction of water withdrawals from the main well field due to a possible future decrease in water availability. Based on KPIs, sustainable long-term strategies are evaluated in order to identify the most suitable solution for dynamic sustainable management of the water supply system. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

As the most fundamental life circle, daily life circle (DLC) planning must adopt a bottom-up approach. However, the widely applicable methods for delineating DLCs remain lacking. This study presents a strategy for delineating DLCs centered on neighborhood commercial areas that aggregate essential daily life services. Correspondingly, a method is proposed for identifying neighborhood commercial areas based on residents' actual usage of facilities. The method was applied in Qinhuai District, Nanjing, where neighborhood commercial areas were identified and the factors influencing their formation and types were quantitatively analyzed. The results indicate the following: (1) the proposed method accurately identifies neighborhood commercial areas that can serve as DLC central areas; (2) commercial diversity, public transportation stops, and parking spots are the three most influential factors in neighborhood commercial area formation, exhibiting non-linear and threshold effects; and (3) the type of neighborhood commercial areas varies by population density, housing prices, and street betweenness, with betweenness being the most significant factor. These findings provide methods and indicators for DLC delineation and planning, contributing to the realization of the DLC construction concept. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

  abstract = {The Renovation Wave is the latest addition to a series of European measures designed to incentivise investment in a low-carbon built environment. In terms of residential retrofits, research has focused on how structural measures can reduce costs through energy savings and improve affordability in the long term. However, it is less clear how retrofit policies can positively impact households with different income levels, energy costs and savings' opportunities across time. EU Member States have provided substantial funding for retrofitting in the form of grants, subsidised loans and tax deductions. This paper addresses with the Netherlands as case study the question: how do different retrofit measures affect the finances and affordability of homeowners in the short and longer term? Our numerical analysis is mainly based on the WoON 2018 dataset, a household-level survey. By focusing on household finances under different financing schemes, this paper aims to place renovation measures in the context of the housing affordability literature. User costs are one of the most important capital-based indicators of long-term affordability. In contrast, cash flows deal with the exchange of money and indicate financial access to housing at a given point in time. In the Dutch context of rising house prices, it is crucial to measure the short and long-term economic impact of energy efficiency measures, as they are likely to have a lasting impact on affordability. Our results show that depending on policy, a majority of homes could be retrofitted with a cost-neutral margin, depending on energy prices and post-retrofit savings. The main barrier to retrofitting is the upfront cost, which threatens short-term affordability. Loans, either subsidised or private, offer an alternative to upfront costs but reduce cost-neutrality. On the other hand, from a user cost perspective, retrofitting lowers costs in the long run. Finally, a cluster analysis shows that middle and higher income groups would be most likely to benefit from retrofitting. This raises the question of the regressive nature and targeting of flat-rate subsidies and tax deductions. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is an important problem especially since a large part of the world's population resides in cities. Comprehending the behaviour of Urban Heat Island (UHI) is necessary to plan cities that offset the climate change effects and offer greater security and quality of life to its inhabitants. In this way, planners need tools to model the UHI and research how cities interact with it. This paper aims to develop a methodological proposal to characterize UHIs in cities by using image data from the ASTER (Advanced Space Thermal Emissions and Radiometric Refection) satellite sensor. The case study is in the city of Valencia in Spain. It is based on data from three moments, for which day and night information are available for an identical ambit. The results provide six maps of the city of Valencia in a period of 4 years: a day and night one for 25 March 2017, 19 August 2018, and 7 May 2021. Hot and cool spots were detected in the city and the shape of the UHI was characterized. A few indicators were calculated to analyse them and study their evolution over time. Finally, we conclude that the use of image data from ASTER satellite offers a powerful infrastructure, easy and cheap to use, to model UHIs in cities. This methodology can be reproduced in many cities, as ASTER images are available for a large list of countries. This experience can be a useful tool in further study to obtain better knowledge about the relation between urban morphology and UHIs, so plan better cities. {\copyright} 2022 WIT Press.},

The literature has focused mainly on cyclical fluctuations in house prices rather than other indicators to account for housing market dynamics, such as residential transactions. This paper investigated the impact of the monetary policy stance on the housing market by considering residential transactions (together with house prices). First, we estimated a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model for Italy from 1999Q1 to 2019Q4 using Cholesky structural identification. Second, we used an external instrument to identify the contemporaneous response of all endogenous variables to the shock of interest (Proxy-VAR). Our results indicate that transactions are more significantly reactive than house prices to a restrictive monetary policy shock. After a policy rate increases, the sudden stop in exchange volumes and the low degree of liquidity perceived in the housing market can contribute to shaping the housing wealth effect captured by prices. The results are supported by a robustness analysis based on local projections. Therefore, policy-makers should consider the role of residential transactions in evaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

The domestic financial cycle, which is characterized by the co-movement of credit and property prices, is a natural subject of such methodology. More precisely, I examine the tails of the joint distribution of US house price growth and household credit growth since the late 1970s to shed some light on the evolution of systemic risk and its links to various economic and financial factors. The analysis finds that the crucial indicators include the banking sector's exposure to household credit, household leverage, house price misalignment, and financial market volatility. This contrasts with the negligible role of real-economy factors. In addition, the estimated effect of monetary policy shocks on systemic risk suggests rejecting the ``leaning against the wind'' strategy. Finally, it is shown that the multiple-output quantile regression framework is a useful tool for forecasting and tracking systemic risk over time. The sustainable growth of house prices and credit can be distinguished from their growth accompanied by the rise in systemic risk to guide policymakers on an appropriate response. {\copyright} 2025 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

This study develops a linear transfer function (LTF) forecasting model for El Paso, Tex., a growing city located in the desert Southwest region of the United States. The model was used to generate monthly frequency out-of-sample simulations of water demand for periods when actual demand was known. To measure the accuracy of the LTF projections against viable alternatives, a set of benchmark forecasts was also developed. Both descriptive accuracy metrics and formal statistical tests were used to analyze predictive performance. The LTF model outperformed the alternatives in predicting demand per customer but fell a little short in projecting growth in the customer base. Changes in climatic and economic conditions were found to affect consumption per customer more rapidly than did changes in water rates.},

In this study, 410 regulatory management units with diverse block features in Xi'an, China were screened as the research samples, and 14 block morphological indicators from three categories of land cover, building group, and distance to cold and heat sources were calculated with multi-source data. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model combined with spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied to quantitatively explore the spatial heterogeneity of land surface temperature (LST) and its relationship to various morphological factors. Results confirm that the GWR model with the better modeling fit (R2 = 0.836, Adj.R2 = 0.785, AICc = 977.510, RMSE = 0.696, and MAPE = 0.013) is an effective method for addressing the spatial relationship between block morphology and LST. Furthermore, the target control strategy was finally proposed in five zoning blocks according to the contribution of morphological variables. ISR is the most influential factor that intensifies the UHI effect, while GR is a critical factor that form the cool urban island in different blocks. Immediate improvement measures should be taken for Zone 1 with the most severe UHI effect by controlling the key indicators of ISR, BD, and GR. This study sheds new light on the spatial variations of the morphology-LST linkage at the block level and provides heat-mitigation regulation recommendations for urban planners and policy makers. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the understanding of the relationship between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and background temperature (T-UHI) is very limited. In this study, the UHI effect induced by the urbanization of the megacity Beijing was investigated using the weather research and forecasting model. Urban expansion and heatwaves both considerably enhanced the UHI effect over urban areas in summer. The strengthened UHI effect during the heatwave period can be clearly explained by the positive sensitivity of T-UHI. The urban expansion increased the sensitivity of T-UHI from 0.0207 degrees C degrees C-1 in 2000 to 0.0569 degrees C degrees C-1 in 2010 in the daytime and from 0.0715 degrees C degrees C-1 in 2000 to 0.0995 degrees C degrees C-1 in 2010 at nighttime, thus resulting in a much stronger UHI effect mainly by increasing the difference between the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux. This enhanced sensitivity may exacerbate the urban heat stress in the situation of further urban expansion and background climate warming. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of T-UHI is a meaningful indicator to assess the urban thermal environment change and support the designing of heat mitigation strategies in urban planning.},

In Brazil, the Para{\'i}ba do Sul River has a great importance as it supplies water for many cities of the Southeast region. Thus, the management of water and wastewater systems demands a more sustainable and efficient scenario. The study's objective was to evaluate, through sustainability indicators, the urban water management system in Volta Redonda (Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil). The selection of sustainability indicators was done through Delphi technique: a group of eight specialists selected the indicators used to evaluate sustainability, its dimension and level of importance. The six criteria for the classification of indicators according to the dimensions of sustainability were: (1) Environmental / Ecological, (2) Economic, (3) Social / Cultural, (4) Technological (5) Ethical and (6) Political / Institutional. Most of the indicators were considered "very important" or just "important". Regarding the dimension of sustainability, 93\% of indicators contemplated more than three dimensions. However, 13 indicators contemplated all the six dimensions as they were multidimensional indicators, analyzed according to the municipal data. The chosen method for the indicator's selection was considered quite satisfactory, since they were able to generate a set of key indicators to show the current municipal water and wastewater scenario. The city has shown satisfactory conditions regarding fresh water supply index. However, some indicators pointed a not sustainable system due to the low wastewater treatment index, precarious state of the river's life and divergences between the basin plan and the municipal director plan. {\copyright} 2022 Universidade Federal do Parana.

A data model of 18 indicators was built to characterize vulnerability. A thermal stress map was developed using the URbCLim model and a heat index was then calculated using Copernicus hourly data (air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) for the period of January 2008--December 2017 at a spatial resolution of 100 m {\texttimes} 100 m. General recommendations at the city level as well as guidelines for development planning in the functional areas at risk are provided, with specifications for the deployment of nature-based solutions as adaptation measures. From a planning perspective, the study positively informs the General Urban Development Plan, the City Green and Biodiversity Plan, and contributes to City Urban Strategy 2030 and City Missions 2030 for climate adaptation and neutrality.

The methodology was validated by considering SDG6 and SDG12 in real urban water systems from knowing that progress or the influence of decision making on its improvement exists. Eight indicators were evaluated in 120 case studies worldwide, of which 24 water systems were located in Spain. The global results showed substantial progress and fair progress in four and two indicators, respectively. The results revealed the alignment between both assessments in Spain.

Time series of surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index are obtained from the MODIS instrument for a 10-year period (2008-2017). The air temperature is collected from the in-situ observational network of 21 stations. The studies are conducted for different locations with gradual changes in urbanization in order to assess the impact of urbanization on the relationship between simultaneous air and surface UHI. The urbanization is described by commonly available land cover metrics. Results showed that the proposed approach provides satisfactory AUHI modeling results for the locations with the least degree of urbanization. The best results are obtained with a simple linear regression model with the iterative procedure to minimize the mean absolute gross error (MAGE).

  abstract = {The domain of house price prediction, also referred to as real estate appraisal, has recently seen a shift from traditional statistical methodologies toward machine learning and deep learning techniques. As housing data is characterized by heterogeneous tabular data, and is subject to spatial dependencies, there is an exigent need for predictive models capable of capturing these complexities. Specifically, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been posited to discern spatial relationships by structuring housing data as graphs. Nevertheless, recent approaches frequently neglect alternative methods for graph construction, or lack a systematic comparative framework for different GNN approaches. Moreover, tree-based models, which are considered the state-of-the-art for tabular data, along with other contemporary methods, are often overlooked when evaluating GNNs. Therefore, this paper performs a comprehensive benchmark of graph construction methods and prevalent GNN models. Furthermore, we compare GNN approaches for house price prediction against an extensive suite of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The results, drawn from six diverse housing datasets, reveal that GNNs are unsuccessful in surpassing machine learning and deep learning baselines. In particular, optimizing the graph structure yields only marginal improvements, with k-nearest neighbor graphs generally exhibiting superior performance. Among the GNN architectures evaluated, GraphSAGE and Transformer-based models demonstrate superior accuracy compared to other GNN variants. Ultimately, the findings suggest a general recommendation against the adoption of GNNs in favor of tree-based models such as LightGBM and CatBoost for house price prediction tasks.},

Using data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper presents a consistency analysis of the performance score method used by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authorities of Tanzania. DEA is appropriate for this purpose because of its demonstrated flexibility in applications with diverse production environments. Thus, this paper proposes methods for benchmarking strategies to assess UWU efficiency- and management-specific goals within and between countries. The assessment shows that network DEA (NDEA) outperforms empirical methods; regulators using the proposed NDEA technique will benchmark UWU efficiency under a yardstick competition regime and, at the same time, identify the most efficient and weak UWUs using pure variable values. This innovation monitors UWU performance progress and promotes sharing of quality management strategies between UWUs and countries. {\copyright} 2019 IWA Publishing.},

The hot-spot analysis was performed by applying Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistics to Land Surface Temperature (LST) layers, obtained from Landsat 8 remote sensing data during the 2015-2019 daytime summer and winter period, to delimitate summer hot- and cool-spots, and winter warm- and cold-spots. Further, these ones were spatially combined thus obtaining a comprehensive summer-winter Thermal Hot-Spot (THSSW) spatial indicator. Winter and summer mean daily thermal comfort profiles were provided for the study area assessing the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) by using meteorological data available from seven local weather stations, located at a maximum distance of 350 m from industrial sites. A specific focus on industrial sites was carried out by analyzing the industrial buildings characteristics and their surrounding areas (50 m buffer), through the following layers: industrial building area (BA), surface albedo of buildings (ALB), impervious area (IA), tree cover (TC), and grassland area (GA). The novel THSSW classification applied to industrial buildings has shown that about 50},

  abstract = {The growing importance of climate change underlines the need to comprehend Urban Heat Islands (UHI), particularly those influenced by urban morphology. As progress has been made in understanding the macroscale relationship between urban morphology and UHIs, the microscale effects are often overlooked. This study, conducted in the city of Erzurum in Turkey, delves into the complex relationship between urban morphology and UHI intensity in different housing areas with distinct microclimates, focusing particularly on street networks, building systems, and land use. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between morphological indicators and UHIs in different housing areas. Key findings include that (1) noticeable UHI effects were observed, especially in dense areas with high-rise buildings. (2) UHIs reveal a strong correlation with both 2D and 3D urban morphological indicators. A moderate-to-high Sky View Factor (SVF) tends to reduce UHIs, while an extremely high SVF aggravates UHIs. (3) Enhancing street network integration emerges as a more effective strategy for mitigating UHI effects in mid-rise buildings compared to other morphological factors. The Normalised Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) may not reliably indicate UHIs in housing areas with a predominantly rural character. Consequently, this article recommends that urban morphology optimisation for UHI mitigation should prioritise spatial and indicator specificity in urban design and spatial planning for cities. Future research endeavours should investigate the influence of morphological indicators on UHI dynamics in different seasons, including various remote sensing indicators related to morphological structure, to enrich our understanding of daily UHI fluctuations within urban morphology research.},

  abstract = {Urban heat stress profoundly affects the health of residents. However, current research primarily focuses on quantifying the risk of urban heat based on LST, Ta, etc., overlooking the crucial and intimate influence of continuous intense solar radiation on human thermal comfort and health. Simultaneously, there is a lack of smaller units to support more precise planning. This study utilized the radiant heat stress intensity (RHSI) metric concentrating on the intensity and duration of thermal radiation, to develop a thermal-radiation induced health risk (TIHR) assessment system. Leveraging technologies such as the SOLWEIG model, Python, BERT, and GIS enables precise calculations of 12 spatial indices, including RHSI and Weibo heat. This facilitates a more accurate assessment of health risks at the smallest urban units (blocks) and directly guides planning. The application of this workflow in the case of Suoyuwan, Dalian, China, confirms its value, as it can be used to determine which blocks should be prioritized for specific aspects of risk prevention and control. The results show that some blocks exhibited differences in TIHR even within close proximity, with disaster-causing factors varying according to locations. This study proposes a novel assessment framework based on the interactive perspective of thermal radiation-human-activity-space. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s)},

This study, utilizing multi-source data and focusing on urban central districts, establishes a refined index system for street spatial form and a thermal comfort prediction model based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The results reveal the following: (1) Thermal comfort levels display spatial heterogeneity, with areas of thermal discomfort concentrated in commercial zones and plaza spaces. (2) Compared to the human-centered perspective, urban morphology indicators correlate strongly with thermal comfort. (3) The key factors influencing thermal comfort, in descending order of importance, are distance from green and blue infrastructure (GBI), tree visibility factor (TVF), street aspect ratio (H/W), orientation, functional diversity indices, and sky view factor. All but the TVF negatively correlates with thermal comfort. (4) In local analyses, the primary factors affecting thermal comfort vary across streets with different heat-risk levels. In high heat-risk streets, thermal comfort is mainly influenced by distance from GBI, H/W, and orientation, whereas in low heat-risk streets, vegetation-related factors dominate. These findings provide a new methodological approach for optimizing urban thermal environments from both urban and human perspectives, offering theoretical insights for creating more comfortable cities. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

Using state-of-the-art epidemiological and climatological datasets, we examined the association between multiple heat stress indicators (HSIs) and daily human mortality in 739 cities worldwide. Notable differences were observed in the long-term trends and timing of heat events detected by HSIs. Air temperature (Tair) predicts heat-related mortality well in cities with a robust negative Tair-relative humidity correlation (CT-RH). However, in cities with near-zero or weak positive CT-RH, HSIs considering humidity provide enhanced predictive power compared to Tair. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of heat-related mortality measured by HSIs could differ largely from those associated with Tair in many cities. Our findings provide important insights into specific regions where humans are vulnerable to humid heat and can facilitate the further enhancement of heat-health alert systems. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

Why housing is expensive in India and what explains the tepid increase in house price growth over the last seven-eight years needs to be understood to address the challenge. Housing is expensive, with a price-to-income ratio of 11, more than twice the affordability benchmark of 5. High house prices are due to structural issues afflicting the real estate sector, such as inefficiencies in land use planning and implementation, semi-transparent nature of the real estate market, and a pervasive shadow economy. These issues and a less-than-competitive industry structure reinforce high prices. To make housing affordable, the focus should be on releasing developable land supply transparently through rigorous land use and implementation. {\copyright} 2024 Economic and Political Weekly.

Although there are numerous indicators that examine urban water resource and demand characteristics, these approaches do not tie together how aspects like economic health, environmental conditions, and population growth correlate with local water conservation to demonstrate a city's ability to cope with water resource vulnerability. This research develops a conceptual framework for the Water-Economy Index (WEI) which characterizes social, economic, and environmental dynamics of water reuse and conservation. The application specifically utilizes a principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate how hydro-economic indicators (including water demand intensity, demand for recycled water, economic productivity of water, unemployment, and allocations of water resources) are correlated and can impact sustainability goals. The PCA method aggregates indicators into three groups: socio-economic, water allocation, and socio-environmental indicators. The most influential indicators within each group are economic productivity of water, wastewater reuse, and consumptive water demand, respectively. The WEI ranks of 49 cities are compared to identify shared traits across individual indicators and to demonstrate the application of the WEI for benchmarking. The results provide insight into the complex relationship between the characteristics of an urban area's water demand and socio-economic performance.}

A total of 1008 interviews were conducted outdoors with concurrent micrometeorological measurements in Tehran, Iran, comparing the preferred, neutral, neutral range, and acceptable ranges of UTCI and PET for subjects exposed to leeward and windward wind directions. The results indicated a deviation of 4.6 {$^\circ$}C in neutral PET (nPET) and 4 {$^\circ$}C in neutral UTCI (nUTCI) between windward and leeward wind directions. Additionally, the results showed that the subjects undergoing leeward wind direction revealed lower sensitivity to wind speed (WS), PET, and UTCI variations, and showed lower neutral and preferred temperatures/WS, and felt thermally acceptable in a wider gap. The results also disclosed that conducting the surveys neglecting the effects of WD may lead to a complete misunderstanding of the climate. Also, the empirical WS benchmarks were determined using techniques regularly used for thermal analysis.

The remote-sensing technique is used to detect land use in 2020 using supervised classification, calculation of LST, and variation of mean LST from this region. The maximum and minimum temperatures are 33 {$^\circ$}C and 18 {$^\circ$}C individually. This study analyzes the LST distribution correlation with different spectral indicator. The relationship between NDVI and SAVI results shows negative correlation (R2 0.20 and 0.15, respectively) because of vegetation area effect on urban expansion. The urban heat island shows positive relation between LST and NDBI and UI because of urbanization and industrial development. The R2 values are show 0.61 and 0.27, respectively. The relationship between MNDWI and NDBal is showing 0.0003 and 0.04 individually. Kolkata metropolitan and surrounding urban areas are increased temperature due to urbanization, climate change and global warming and overuse of public vehicles. The UHI was increased due to anthropological activities. This study helps to identify the recent thermal variation of this area and build a proper management and planning for sustainable urban development. {\copyright} 2021, University of Tehran.},

  abstract = {In the field of water management, the evaluation of sustainability has no universal methodological approach nor any consensus regarding the definitions of sustainability or sustainable development. There is an essential need therefore for a precise definition of sustainability in different water management fields. This paper deals with the sustainability of one part of urban water management, namely a water supply. A precise definition of a sustainable water supply system is given, together with a methodological framework that quantifies the degree of water supply sustainability. The proposed framework relies on the proposed quasi-strong sustainability concept, its components (dimensions), their particular relationships and corresponding indicators representing individual processes in the water supply system and utility. The processing of indicators is performed through a joint fuzzy logic/neural network (ANFIS) model. In order to evaluate each sustainability component, separate ANFIS models were created whose results were aggregated into a single result (sustainability index). According to the presented framework, sustainability is evaluated for 17 public water supply systems/utilities in Croatia.}

  abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) refers to the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban areas and their undeveloped or underdeveloped surroundings. It is a measure of the thermal influence of the urban built-up area expansion (UBAE), a topic that has been extensively studied. However, the impact of UBAE on the LST differences between urban areas and rural areas (UHIU-R) and between urban areas and emerging urban areas (UHIU-S) in different seasons has seldom been investigated. Here, the UHIU-S and UHIU-R in 34 major metropolitan regions across China, and their spatiotemporal variations based on long-term space-borne observations during the period 2001-2020 were analyzed. The UBAE quantified by the difference in landscape metrics of built-up areas between 2020 and 2000 and their impact on UHI was further analyzed. The UBAE is impacted by the level of economic development and topography. The UBAE of cities located in more developed regions was more significant than that in less developed regions. Coastal cities experienced the most obvious UBAE, followed by plain and hilly cities. The UBAE in mountainous regions was the weakest. On an annual basis, UHIU-R was larger than UHIU-S, decreasing more slowly with UBAE than UHIU-S. In different seasons, the UHIU-S and UHIU-R were larger, more clearly varying temporally with UBAE in summer than in winter, and their temporal variations were significantly correlated with UBAE in summer but not in winter. The seasonal difference in UHIU-R was larger than that of UHIU-S. Both the UHIU-S and UHIU-R in coastal cities were the lowest in summer, decreasing the fastest with UBAE, while those in mountain cities decreased the slowest. The change in the density of built-up lands was the primary driver affecting the temporal variations in UHIU-S and UHIU-R during UBAE, followed by changes in proportion and shape, while the impact of the speed of expansion was the smallest, all of which were more obvious in summer than in winter. The decreased density of built-up lands can reduce UHI. These findings provide a new perspective for a deeper understanding of the effect of urban expansion on LST in different seasons.},

The impacts of urban landscapes on LST have been extensively explored, mainly focusing on grid scale and the daytime. However, how 2D/3D urban landscapes affect diurnal LST at the block scale is unclear. Therefore, taking 1, 536 blocks (including low-rise blocks (LRB), middle-rise blocks (MRB), and high-rise blocks (HRB)) in Beijing as samples, the performances of boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) were first evaluated, and the impacts of 2D/3D urban landscapes on diurnal LST across different block types were explored. The results showed that the mean LST was the highest in MRB (daytime) and HRB (nighttime). BRT performed better than RF in investigating diurnal impacts at the block scale. Vegetation and buildings are the domain factors influencing daytime and nighttime LST in LRB and MRB, while buildings are the domain factor in HRB except at 03:09 (impervious surface). The relationships between the key 2D/3D urban landscape metrics and block diurnal LST are nonlinear. The findings can serve as f basis for UHI mitigation and urban renewal strategies by urban planners to develop thermal comfort.},

However, general conclusions on their relationship have not been drawn, owing to the differences in climatic, social, and economic conditions between cities. Moreover, the multivariate and nonlinearity of the three-dimensional (3D) indicators also require more robust and specific statistical models. In this study, the random forest (RF) regression model was used to quantitatively analyse the seasonal differences in the responses of nine multi-dimensional building indicators to LST. The results show that the building coverage ratio (BCR), high building ratio (HBR), and architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) always had the most substantial influence.

The scale of economic inequality in London has called for more effective policy tools to leverage poverty and close the gaps of economic inequality. Opportunity Areas is one of the tools in urban regeneration to alleviate poverty and develop communities. After over a decade of the policy rollout we have little knowledge how effective this type of policy tool is. The project investigates how effective opportunity areas for economic growth and societal development in London. The key economic indicators including unemployment rate and house price were assessed at MSOA/ward levels in London to understand their spatial variation through GIS mapping. Subsequently, socio-economic factors of commercial land use, culture infrastructure and public transport accessibility were discussed and selected to explore whether they have impacts on the difference of economic performance within opportunity areas. The spatial impacts of these factors among wards/MSOA were evaluated by Geographically Weighted Regression. The research discussed these factors' variations in Lee Valley, Park Royal and Croydon.

Housing affordability is measured by two (2) indicators, namely the Median Multiple and Down-Market Penetration. Through the Median Multiple method, the cost of housing median is found to be lower than three (3) times the median household yearly income. Meanwhile, Down-Market Penetration suggests that the minimum cost of the new house, which is set by the private sector without subsidies, is affordable. This article attempts to explore and review the meaning of housing affordability in Malaysia. Reducing the house price, which is the sole method of solving the problem related to the housing affordability issue, is overly emphasised. Instead, more focus should be placed on the addition of supplies and the provision of commodities based on market demand. It should be noted that a more common approach, which includes the method incorporated by the ministries of the government, is crucial to achieving housing affordability. {\copyright} 2021, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

It is argued that the urban configuration affects the micro-climate of the urban outdoor spaces. The street's orientation form was identified as an element, which impacts the urban environment with regards of receiving passive solar, solar radiation and reflection against urban absorption, wind flow and the possible urban cooling techniques. The key purpose of this study is to look into the urban configuration factors affecting the human thermal outdoor comfort in Jeddah city as an example of hot humid climate regions. To accomplish its aim, the research is divided to two sections. The first one illustrates the problem of the research, then generally reviews the literature associated with the outdoor human thermal comfort; in addition, it discusses the relationship between street orientation and micro-climate. The second section highlight the assessments carried out between four different orientations of urban streets from two different districts in Jeddah city, using ENVI-met software. The research adopts three environmental variables to be examined, namely air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity together with pedestrian thermal comfort as indicators for predicted mean vote, during summer and winter seasons. The outcomes of the comparison assist to identify decisions related street networks to achieve the desirable human outdoor thermal comfort in such an urban environment. {\copyright} 2020 The Author(s).

A case study at a high-density area in Wuhan investigated the impacts of 27 indicators, including area proportion (AP), plot ratio (PR), and landscape fragmentation index (LFI), on LST at ten different spatial scales. The effects of individual and combined GBGI characteristics on LST were examined with correlation tests and multiple regression models, respectively. In single-factor test, LST is most sensitive to blue infrastructure (BI) and grey infrastructure (GYI) at 1600 m. BI\_AP, BI\_PR, River\_AP, GYI\_AP, Pavement\_AP, and Building\_AP showed strong correlations with LST at all scales. Regarding GNI (green infrastructure), LST is the most sensitive to GNI\_LFI and Woodland\_LFI at 1600 m, while to GNI\_AP and GNI\_PR at 50 m. In the hybrid state, LST has the highest sensitivity to GBGI sub-components at the district scale (1200--1600 m) based on multiple regression models.

However, distance between two points in space can be mainly conceptualised in three ways---straight-line, road-network and travel time-related overland. Therefore, the particular distance measure that portrays `reality' as closely as possible in a given study is context-specific. We examine the implications of using different distance measures when analysing house prices. This Sydney case study used spatial econometric techniques as a robust mechanism to compare different distance measures. The disaggregated analysis of the three city regions confirmed that distinct distance metrics have specific effects on house prices. Including in the modelling process how residents perceive and value their proximity seems to improve the accuracy of `city centre effects'. A separate section links these findings to prevalent travel modes in different parts of Sydney, and it suggests there are three different cities in Sydney in terms of residents' willingness to pay to live close to the city centre and preferred travel modes. While we reveal how residents' preferences for transport modes are reflected in house prices, we emphasise the need for specific types of transport infrastructure (e.g., roads, highways and footpaths) in given regions. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

Those would enable the increased demand and boost other areas of the economy through stakeholders' effect in the supply and business capacities concerning its management, recognizing the expectations in the formulation and elaboration of projects in the current context. Nevertheless, companies related to the construction sector do not have adequate tools and personnel for this integral development, allowing them to identify factors when evaluating stakeholder management's business capacities, contributing to generating new methodologies and instruments that enable increasing construction projects' success.},

More specifically, the study tries to identify objective norms that maximize this relationship. The data is taken from the EU-SILC 2016 and the Flemish Housing Survey 2013. The analysis suggests that in Flanders a ratio with variable norms (by income groups) more closely reflects the subjective perception of affordability problems than the ratio indicators with fixed norms.

The US National Weather Service uses temperature and relative humidity to build a heat index (HI) as a metric to identify the thresholds for heat stress as felt by the public. Under climate change conditions and especially in hot humid weather during summer, the number of hot days in Hanoi has increased in recent times. Subsequently, the heat index is rising in both number of occurrences and level of intensity leading to increasing temperature stress on people's health. The daily heat index for the future was simulated using maximum daily temperature and minimum daily relative humidity based on climate change scenarios. Maximum daily temperature was provided by the climate change model, while minimum daily relative humidity was estimated from the following: maximum daily temperature, mean daily temperature and daily rainfall. Results show that in the future, the heat index will increase by 0.0777{$^\circ$}C/year in the RCP 4.5 scenario and 0.08{$^\circ$}C/year in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Number of weeks with heat at danger tends to increase to 5.5 weeks/5 year for scenario RCP 4.5, and it is 6 weeks/5 years under RCP 8.5 scenario. In particular, the number of days of heatstroke over a 30-year period (from 1991 to 2020) amounted to only 4, that is an average of 0.13 days of the year, which represents a very rare weather phenomenon in the past. In contrast, under an RCP 4.5 scenario in the future over a 30-year period, the average number of days per year will be 2, 57 days; while the average number of days per year under an RCP 8.5 scenario would be 3, 87 days. This phenomenon will be mainly concentrated in the months of June, July, and August. Projections of this type are a key tool for communities working out how they will adapt to heat stress in the context of climate change.

This shift is not merely an option but an imperative, driven by the rapidly evolving urban landscape. In addressing this imperative, a crucial decision support tool that has emerged as an asset in the domain of urban water planning and management is the Urban Water Use (UWU) tool. This tool offers an integrated approach for strategic planning, promoting urban water conservation and environmental health through the investigation of interventions in urban infrastructure under different scenarios. In this study, the latest version of this UWU tool was deployed in a case study conducted in Almirante Tamandar{\'e}, Brazil. The objective was to evaluate how an integrated decision-making approach concerning urban water systems influences the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions, ultimately contributing to achieve widespread adoption, accessibility, and relevance of urban water services. The refined UWU tool evaluates a spectrum of measures across diverse scenarios, incorporating various drivers, focusing on the stakeholders' visions for the locality. These visions are composed of sustainability indicators, specifying different sets of target values and importance weights for each indicator. The approach followed in this study demonstrates how the effectiveness indexes can vary based on stakeholders' perception. Measures under Water Sensitive Urban Design and Water Demand Management strategies were deployed to simulate the response of urban water systems under three distinct scenarios, embracing the complexities of social dynamics and of climate change. The findings of the study emphasize that realizing a desired vision through selected measures relies significantly on the adoption of an integrated approach within the decision-making process. The stakeholders' perception of how indicators should be weighted while defining the vision was found to significantly impact the effectiveness range of these measures. {\copyright} 2023},

To reach these multiple goals, the design of an optimal rate structure would ideally include detailed information on cost of service, demand elasticity, and preferences of the customer base within each utility. However this information is often unavailable, especially when analyzing utilities at regional or national scales. In this absence, the comparison or benchmarking of rate structures across utilities may reveal insights regarding the features, management, or performance of one utility relative to another. We review the metrics and methods available to water utility managers for comparing rate structures with publicly available information. By presenting the full range of metrics available to utility managers, we aim to facilitate the comparison of water rate structures, and ensure that the analysts can select the metric that best fits their needs. To illustrate how these metrics may help generate insight, we use them to compare the rate structures of five municipalities in Canada. Despite the contextual differences, we find that the rates tend to converge at a single metric, the Canadian standard of 25m3/month, suggesting that there is a "looking over the shoulder effect" in which managers are probably cognizant of the metrics used to compare them to others. We suggest that the design or re-design of rate structures can be informed by the metrics that compare rates across utilities, despite the limitations of working with only publicly available information. {\copyright} 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.}

Our goal is a comprehensive assessment of the development of Slovak mortgage banking for the past 20 years from the perspectives of the development of banking, the mortgage bond market, the real estate market and selected interactions between individual elements of the mortgage system. The specific aim of the study is to evaluate the substantial links between the basic economic indicators, indicators of housing finance and real estate prices in Slovakia. To evaluate these issues VAR (Vector Autoregression) models, models of panel and linear regression and DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) models were used. Slovakia has specific indicators of the development of mortgage banking, adequate to its historical and economic development. It was confirmed that the availability of real estate loans had a significant impact on the increase in real estate prices. Real estate prices in Bratislava have different development factors than real estate prices from a nationwide perspective. Low interest rates have an important role in housing financing. The second part of the study is oriented towards an evaluation of the technical efficiency of individual banks. The results of DEA point out that the largest banks in Slovakia were the most efficient in the pre-crisis year 2007. The overall results show that policymakers should react not only to the household indebtedness rate and risks for individual clients, but should also see the risks for banks in possible changes in the real estate market, or the risks of changes in interest rates in the future. {\copyright} 2020 by the author.

Mitigating climate change undoubtedly requires smarter urban design tools and techniques than ever before. With the continuous evolution of geospatial technologies and an added benefit of analyzing and virtually visualizing our world in three dimensions, the focus is now shifting from a traditional 2D to a more complicated 3D spatial design and assessment with increasing potential of supporting climate-responsive urban decisions. This paper focuses on using 3D city models to calculate the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) as an outdoor thermal comfort indicator in terms of assessing the spatiotemporal distribution of heat stress on the district scale. The analysis is done to evaluate planning scenarios for a district transformation in Montreal/Canada. The research identifies a systematic workflow to assess and upgrade the outdoor thermal comfort using the contribution of ArcGIS CityEngine for 3D city modeling and the open-source model of solar longwave environmental irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) as the climate assessment model. A statistically downscaled weather profile for the warmest year predicted before 2050 (2047) is used for climate data. The outcome shows the workflow capacity for the structured recognition of area under heat stress alongside supporting the efficient intervention, the tree placement as a passive strategy of heat mitigation. The adaptability of workflow with the various urban scale makes it an effective response to the technical challenges of urban designers for decision-making and action planning. However, the discovered technical issues in data conversion and wall surface albedo processing call for the climate assessment model improvement as future demand. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

Although they might appear contradictory, they jointly support the comprehensive sustainable urban development strategy. Traditional methods usually focus on assessing this balance from a specific perspective, such as how neighborhood greenery shapes real estate value. Yet, they fail to deliver a holistic balance assessment in developing the physical and socioeconomic dimensions. To fill this gap, this study introduces a research framework that measures this balance through house prices based on transferred bias. Using house price as an indicator shaped by both physical and socioeconomic environments, the framework first constructs a series of deep learning models to estimate house prices through street view images for each city. These models capture the relationship between neighborhood appearance and house price. Second, by leveraging transfer inference, we introduce neighborhood appearance from one city into the model trained from another city. This process identifies the transferred bias, which is the disparity between inaccurate inference resulting from a mismatched neighborhood appearance and the trained model. Through transferred bias, we can quantify the differences in physical and socioeconomic environments across cities and evaluate the urban balances of these two environments. The results show that the transferred bias effectively quantifies the disparities among cities in physical and socioeconomic environments, thereby facilitating further investigation into the urban balance between these two environments. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).},

Growing extreme heat events caused by climate change have a serious impact on OTCs, especially in urban areas. Quantitatively characterizing and evaluating the spatiotemporal changes in OTCs are essential, and more applications are needed in urban agglomerations. Therefore, taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the study area, this study aimed to quantitatively assess the summer regional OTC from 1981 to 2020. First, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was used as the indicator of daily thermal stress, and then a Composite Thermal Comfort Score was proposed to evaluate the long-term, summertime, regional OTC considering the extent, duration, and intensity of daytime and nighttime thermal stress. The results showed that (a) the increase in UTCI (0.32?/10a at daytime and 0.21?/10a at nighttime) and heat stress frequency (0.88 at daytime and 0.39 d/10a at nighttime) were manifested over BTH, indicating a worse OTC. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity was also demonstrated. (b) The general OTC showed a decreasing north-south gradient pattern. At daytime, the northern mountainous zone presented the best OTC, the southern plain zone, especially Hengshui, Langfang, and Cangzhou, showed the worst. At nighttime, the mountain-plain transition zone showed the best OTC, the northern mountainous zone showed the worst since more cold stress occurred. Our findings will be useful in informing climate change adaptation strategies to ensure urban resilience as extreme heat increases in the context of climate change.},

Structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) models are estimated to test his more contentious causal claim. Our results show that housing indicators lead business cycles in most countries and that leading relationship is more prominent in the long run. In addition, our SVAR results for the United States indicate that housing factors are likely independent drivers of business cycles. Housing supply indicators predict short-run variations in business cycles, and housing price predicts long-run variations better. The cross-country evidence is less certain.

The framework tracks monetary policies timings through threshold regime-switching phenomena. The estimated low-growth regimes are synchronous with the two bubble-like housing busts in the 1990s and 2006-2007, as well as historical downward movements in the interest rate. The threshold indicator, the moving-average housing price return, indicates a counterintuitively positive association between cyclical housing price returns and the interest rate in the housing bust regimes of many metropolitan housing markets.

Land cover and LST have been studied in various cities; however, indicative research into heterogeneous LCC's impact on LST in less-developed cities remains incomplete. This study analyzed new Landsat images of Zhanjiang, taken from 2004 to 2022, to determine the impact of three LCC indicators (compositions, parameters, and patterns) on LSTs. The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) was used to describe the distribution and variation in LST. We also quantified the cooling or warming benefits of various LCCs. The results indicate that the average temperature in the land urban heat island (SUHI) area rose to 30.6 {$^\circ$}C. The average temperature of the SUHI was 3.32 {$^\circ$}C higher than that of the non-SUHI area, showing the characteristic of shifting to counties and multi-core development. The LST increases by 0.37--0.67 {$^\circ$}C with an increase of 0.1 in the normalized difference building index (NDBI), which is greater than the cooling benefit of the normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI). The impact of landscape pattern indices on impervious surfaces and water is higher than that on vegetation and cropland, with a rising influence on impervious surfaces and a decreasing impact on water. The predominant cooling patches are vegetation and water, while large areas of impervious surface and cropland aggravate UHIs for industrial and agricultural activities. These findings are intended to guide future urban layouts and planning in less-developed cities, with thermal climate mitigation as a guiding principle. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

However, existing literature has commonly reported a linear relationship between housing sales prices and the academic performance of nearby schools. This study challenges this prevalent understanding by examining how the entrance opportunity as an integral part of school quality affects both housing sales prices and housing rental prices, in response to the newly adopted point-based school enrolment policy in China whereby tenants are allowed to access local public schools but with fewer opportunities compared to homeowners. Employing machine learning algorithms, this study identifies which key school indicators and what ranges of these indicators have significant impacts on different housing sales and rental price segments in Shenzhen, China. Our results reveal that housing rental prices, particularly in the lower-priced segment, are more determined by the entrance opportunity than the academic performance, while the latter is the most important factor influencing housing sales prices. The nonlinear capitalization effect suggests that tenants and homebuyers are willing to pay more for school quality increases only within specific ranges, namely, from median to a relatively high level of school quality. These findings contribute to a more nuanced and updated understanding of the education capitalization effect and thus inform more inclusive and equitable urban planning and governance.},

  abstract = {As urban green spaces have significant cooling effects on the urban heat island (UHI), a precise understanding of these effects is necessary to devise precise greenspace strategies for abating the UHI. This paper explores the impacts of different greenspace (trees, grass, and water) patterns on the UHI in Beijing's Olympic Area, using different grid cell sizes and spatial statistical models. Greenspace pattern metrics include percent cover, mean patch size (MPS), mean patch shape index (MSI), edge density (ED), and largest percent index (LPI). The results show that different greenspace metrics have varying effects on surface temperature. The spatial error model (SEM) turns out to be a good choice for estimating the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the greenspace metrics. The regression coefficients of these metrics vary with grid cell size. Tree and grass edge densities have opposite effects, which suggest that trees should be planted in smaller clusters, whereas grass should be planted in larger and continuous patches in order to reach maximum LST cooling. The optimal grid cell size is in the [120--240 m] range. These findings can help urban planners mitigate the UHI in a city with limited green space availability. {\copyright} 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

It is a social or ethical issue and an essential economic direction. Thus, affordable housing has great potential, influencing economic growth, labor forces, innovation, sustainable development, and an inclusive economy. Systematization of informational sources, theoretical and practical approaches for providing affordable housing, and assessing social housing needs indicated many views on this problem among scholars and policymakers. That is why marketing, management, and financial providing of affordable housing are significant mainstreams. The research aims to investigate marketing and management fundamentals of providing affordable housing in connection with funding aspects based on cross-country analysis. For achieving this target, key trends o f housing market segmentation were analyzed, considering the distribution of the population by tenure status and analytical house price indicators using the data of the statistical office of the EU, the World Bank, and the OECD. The ways to promote more affordable housing by public and local authorities, private investors in affordable housing, and specific social and affordable housing market organizations were described. Main organizational forms of providing affordable and social housing were also characterized. Particular attention was paid to strategic planning for affordable and social housing, especially housing business plans or affordable housing strategy development as a priority step in marketing, management, and financial providing affordable housing. A SWOT analysis for affordable housing developments was used to show strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the affordable housing market. To empirically confirm some relevant strengths, the impact of indicators of financial providing of affordable housing was formalized based on correlation analysis (calculating Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients with time lags based on results of Shapiro-Wilk testing) and construction of Arellano-Bond linear dynamic panel-data regression model with checking the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions (the sample from 25 EU countries for 2011-2019) using the Excel 2010 and STATA 14.2 software. The dynamic model made it possible to consider the share of affordable housing owners with mortgage or loan or the share of tenants, rent affordable housing at a reduced price or free.

This paper utilises the Ladybug tools simulation plugins to investigate the impact of changing the morphological characteristics of three-block typologies (scattered, linear and courtyard) and their associated parameters to understand their multidimensional relationship with environmental conditions, outdoor thermal comfort and energy use intensity. This study based in Cairo, Egypt, considers 3430 hypothetical geometrical configurations comprising of a variety of design parameters and indicators. The results show a strong correlation between the design parameters and the combined performance of thermal comfort and energy consumption (R-2 = 0.84), with urban density having the strongest impact on both thermal comfort and energy use (R-2 = 0.7 and 0.95, respectively). The design parameters exhibited a consistent impact on the different typologies, albeit with varying magnitude. Compact and medium-density urban forms are shown to elicit the best overall performance, especially for ordinal orientations (e.g., similar to 45 degrees) across all typologies. Compact high-density scattered forms are favoured when considering thermal comfort, while courtyards outperform other typologies when considering energy efficiency and overall performance.},

Consequently, an immense land use change is related to local climate modification in urban areas. The process of urbanization in the city of Lahore is posing severe environmental issues such as recent smog events. The objective here is to determine and analyze the spatial variability of land surface temperature (LST) caused by the land use land cover (LULC) change between the year 1996 and 2016 in Lahore in the context of urbanization and, based on this, to predict the land use change and corresponding increase in LST in 2035. To quantify LULC change during the 1996--2016 period, we used supervised maximum likelihood method and ground observations from 400 locations to classify the satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) for the years 1996, 2010, and 2016. Moreover, to better understand spatial variability of surface urban heat island (UHI) with the process of urbanization, various indicators were derived from the remote sensing imagery, including the normalized difference vegetation and built-up indices (i.e., NDVI and NDBI, respectively). Moreover, we used an RS-integrated multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain analysis (MLP-MCA) model to predict the LULC change from the year 2016 to 2035 so that the predicted LULC change, as a driver of UHI, can be related to the future local climate of the city. Through relating LST with NDVI and NDBI, we reveal that rapid developments in the residential/infrastructural sectors are causing an immense degradation in the city vegetation areas. The LULC change analyses show that about 9},

Design/methodology/approach: The bootstrap panel Granger causality approach that accounts for cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity and structural breaks is used to detect the direction of causality. Findings: The empirical findings for the overall panel support the presence of unidirectional causality running from house prices to unemployment. Practical implications: The findings are not only important for households but also for policymakers concerned with economic and financial stability. Originality/value: There are only a limited number of studies that have investigated the direct link between house prices and employment or unemployment. Given the increased importance of labor market variables, particularly the choice of the unemployment rate as a key indicator in designing forward guidance and the increased financial stability concerns regarding house price dynamics, it is important to better understand the causal linkages between house prices and unemployment rates. To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first to apply the bootstrap panel Granger causality approach to examine the relationship between house prices and unemployment rates. {\copyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, humid heat extremes are fundamentally compound events, and a given Tw can be generated by various combinations of temperature and humidity. Differentiating between extreme humid heat driven by temperature versus humidity is essential to identifying these extremes' physical drivers and preparing for their distinct impacts. Here we explore the variety of combinations of temperature and humidity contributing to humid heat experienced across the globe. In addition to using traditional metrics, we derive a novel thermodynamic state variable named ``stickiness.'' Analogous to the oceanographic variable ``spice'' (which quantifies the relative contributions of temperature and salinity to a given water density), stickiness quantifies the relative contributions of temperature and specific humidity to a given Tw. Consistent across metrics, we find that high magnitudes of Tw tend to occur in the presence of anomalously high moisture, with temperature anomalies of secondary importance. This widespread humidity dependence is consistent with the nonlinear relationship between temperature and specific humidity as prescribed by the Clausius--Clapeyron relationship. Nonetheless, there is a range of stickiness observed at moderate-to-high Tw thresholds. Stickiness allows a more objective evaluation of spatial and temporal variability in the temperature versus humidity dependence of humid heat than traditional variables. In regions with high temporal variability in stickiness, predictive skill for humid heat-related impacts may improve by considering fluctuations in atmospheric humidity in addition to dry-bulb temperature. {\copyright} 2024 American Meteorological Society.},

The field of water resources is described by indicators related to the water resources availability, annual precipitation and the ratio of treated water, while the water services field is described by indicators related to the water service coverage, water losses and the continuity of water supply. Water governance includes three indicators: role and responsibility, access to water information and stakeholder engagement. Water security assessment is conducted in three stages: (i) data collection for five Palestinian cities in the West Bank of Jordan, (ii) determination of the risk score for each indicator using collected data and an expert's opinion, (iii) determination of the global water security score and water security index using the matrix risk assessment and the wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) methods. Results show that water risk is ranked as extreme for all cities. Risk related to water resources is a major contributor to global risk, followed by water governance.},

This is generally seen as an indispensable factor in the development and growth of an individual and Household. However, diverse issues affect the realisation and sustainability of Housing across countries, most notably in developing nations like Nigeria. The housing crisis in the country has been associated with factors like poor household structure developing systems such as an ever-increasing household formation and old existing stock without a significant increase in new Housing Construction. This paper appraises or documents sustainable Housing delivery in Metropolitan Lagos based on the quality and adequacy of Housing, as an essential indicator of economic development. The operation of the private sector as the most significant contributor to Housing delivery is majorly explored in the study, to suggest how to improve the quality of lives of the urban residents. A combination of self-administered questionnaires and in-depth personal interviews were used for data collection instruments in this study. Sixty (60) participants, representing the number of Property developers across Lagos Metropolis, were used for the study. Kruskal-Wallis test of significance was used to test the hypothesis. The result of the analysis indicated that there no significant difference in constraints limiting the Sustainable Housing delivery in Metropolitan Lagos by private developers. Hence, the null hypothesis was rejected for all the variables at p{\textexclamdown}0.05 level of significance. The finding suggests that there are constraints that contribute to the limitation of Sustainable Housing delivery in Lagos State by Private Developers and the obstacles have varying but non-significant different contributions. It is assumed that the identified associated restriction would give an insight into solving the issue of adequate Housing provision in achieving the desired sustainability.

In this study, we evaluated the association between the urban heat anomaly and heat-related mortality risk in the summer and the potential roles of multiple types of LULC indicators. We used district-level time-series and cadastral data from 51 urban districts in the national capital region of South Korea. We applied a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, we estimated the district-specific heat-related mortality risk by using a distributed lag non-linear model. In the second stage, we used a meta-analysis to pool the estimates across all districts and calculate the association between the urban heat anomaly/LULC indicators and heat-related mortality risk. We found that the higher urban heat anomaly was related to lower vegetation and higher urban surface indicators, and the urban heat anomaly was positively associated with the heat-related mortality risk. The association between the urban heat anomaly and the heat-related mortality risk was more pronounced in the elderly (age {$\geq$} 65 years) and female population than in the non-elderly and male population. We also found that the LULC indicators affected the heat-related mortality only through the urban heat anomaly. Our findings indicate that urban areas may be more vulnerable to heat-related mortality risk as determined by the urban heat anomaly. These results suggest a need for urban heat mitigation strategies such as increased vegetation or surface albedo to help reduce heat-related mortality risk. {\copyright} 2020 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Extreme heat is one of the most pressing climate risks in the United States and is exacerbated by a warming climate and aging population. Much work in heat health has focused only on temperature-based metrics, which do not fully measure the physiological impact of heat stress on the human body. The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) consists of 139 sites across the United States and includes meteorological parameters that fully encompass human tolerance to heat, including relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation. Hourly and 5-min observations from USCRN are used to develop heat exposure products, including heat index (HI), apparent temperature (AT), and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Validation of this product is conducted with nearby airport and mesonet stations, with reanalysis data used to fill in data gaps. Using these derived heat products, two separate analyses are conducted. The first is based on standardized anomalies, which place current heat state in the context of a long-term climate record. In the second study, heat events are classified by time spent at various levels of severity of conditions. There is no consensus as to what defines a heat event, so a comparison of absolute thresholds (i.e., 30.08,35.08,and40.08C)andrelativethresholds(90th, 95th, and 98th percentile) will be examined. The efficacy of the product set will be studied using an extreme heat case study in the southeastern United States. While no heat exposure metric is deemed superior, each has their own advantages and caveats, especially in the context of public communication. {\copyright} 2021 American Meteorological Society.},

The advances in satellite measurement are facilitating the analysis of this phenomenon using Land Surface Temperature (LST) as an indicator of the Surface UHI (SUHI). Due to the spatial implications of using remote sensing data, this research developed ArcUHI, a Geographic Information System (GIS) add-in for modelling SUHI. The tool was designed in ArcGIS, which was bound with R to run machine learning algorithms in the background. ArcUHI was tested using the metropolitan area of Madrid (Spain) in 2006, 2012 and 2018 as a case study. The add-in was found to predict observed LST with high accuracy, especially when using Random Forest Regression (RFR). Building height and albedo were identified as the main drivers of SUHI, whose magnitude and extension increased with time. In view of these results, strategic roof and wall greening was suggested as a measure to mitigate the street canyon effect entailed by buildings and offset the heat retention capacity of built-up surfaces. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal features of urban heat island (UHI) intensity in complex urban terrain are barely investigated. This study examines the UHI intensity variations in mountainous Chongqing using a dense surface monitoring network. The results show that the UHI intensity is closely related to underlying surfaces, and the strongest UHI intensity is confined around the central urban areas. The UHI intensity is most prominent at night and in warm season, and the magnitude could reach  4.5 {$^\circ$} C on summer night. Our quantitative analysis shows a profound contribution of urbanization level to UHI intensity both at night and in summer, with regression coefficient b = 4.31 and 6.65, respectively. At night, the urban extra heat such as reflections of longwave radiation by buildings and release of daytime-stored heat from artificial materials, is added into the boundary layer, which compensates part of urban heat loss and thus leads to stronger UHI intensity. In summer, the urban areas are frequently contro lled by oppressively hot weather. Due to increased usage of air conditioning, more anthropogenic heat is released. As a result, the urban temperatures are higher at night. The near-surface wind speed can serve as an indicator predicting UHI intensity variations only in the diurnal cycle. The rural cooling rate during early evening transition, however, is an appropriate factor to estimate the magnitude of UHI intensity both at night and in summer. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Observed surface air temperature (SAT) warming at urban stations often contains both the signal of global warming and that of local urban heat island (UHI) effects; these signals are difficult to separate. In this study, an urban impact indicator (Uii) developed by the authors was modified to represent the extent to which the observed temperature from a given station was influenced by UHI effects. The Uii of a city was calculated by simplifying the city's shape to a circle. In addition, a modified Uii (MUii) was calculated by considering the realistic hori-zontal distribution of the urban land. We selected 45 urban stations in mainland China, along with an adjacent station for each to give a station pair. Background climate changes across each pair were near-homogeneous. Thus, differences in the trends of annual averaged daily mean SAT (Trendmean), maximum SAT (Trendmax), and minimum SAT (Trendmin) between the urban and adjacent stations ({$\Delta$}Trend) could be mainly attributed to differences in MUii changes between the urban and adjacent stations ({$\Delta$}MUii). Several linear regressions between {$\Delta$}Trend and {$\Delta$}MUii for the 45 station pairs were calculated to estimate UHI effects on Trendmean (UTmean), Trendmax (UTmax), and Trendmin (UTmin). The results showed that the mean MUii of the 45 urban stations increased from 0.06 to 0.35 during 1992 -- 2013. Positive correlations between {$\Delta$}MUii and {$\Delta$}Trend for the 45 station pairs were significant at the 0.001 significance level (except for Trendmax). The average UTmean and UTmin of the 45 urban stations during 1954 -- 2013 were approximately 0.05 and 0.11{$^\circ$}C decade-1, respectively, accounting for 18},

In theory and practice, the quality of urban life is determined by a wide variety of factors. This article focuses on housing infrastructure as a determinant of the quality of life in selected Polish Smart Cities and seeks answers to the question: What is the level of variation in the availability and quality of housing infrastructure in the studied cities and against the provinces in which they are located? In solving the research problem formulated in this way, the following were used: (1) Indicators determining the quality and accessibility of housing infrastructure at the level of the studied cities and provinces; (2) a multiple case study (for eight cities from different regions of Poland); and (3) a comparative analysis conducted at the level of the cities and provinces in which they operate. The resulting analyses indicate that there are differences in the availability and quality of housing infrastructure at the level of smart cities and provinces representing the regional average. The analyzed cities—in all the criteria studied (except the area of the apartment)—dominate over the provinces, which means that they have larger and better housing resources than the rest of the region. © 2022 by the author.},

To better assess the threats climate change poses to human health, the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is an important indicator of human heat stress. This study utilized high-resolution reanalysis data from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF ERA5) to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in outdoor WBGT across Bangladesh from 1979 to 2021, employing Liljegren's model. The study revealed an increase in the annual average WBGT by 0.08--0.5 {$^\circ$}C per decade throughout the country, with a more pronounced rise in the southeast and northeast regions. Additionally, the number of days with WBGT levels associated with high and extreme risks of heat-related illnesses has shown an upward trend. Specifically, during the monsoon period (June to September), there has been an increase of 2--4 days per decade, and during the pre-monsoon period (March to May), an increase of 1--3 days per decade from 1979 to 2021. Furthermore, the results indicated that the escalation in WBGT has led to a five-fold increase in affected areas and a three-fold increase in days of high and extreme heat stress during the monsoon season in recent years compared to the earlier period. Trend and relative importance analyses of various meteorological variables demonstrated that air temperature is the primary driver behind Bangladesh's rising WBGT and related health risks, followed by specific humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

Empirical studies by New Urbanists argue that mixed land use, neo-traditional, and walkable neighborhoods yield socioeconomic benefits and generate a substantial premium in residential property prices. However, few studies apply reliable metrics to capture the connections among urban form, the spatial distribution of land use, and travel behavior and then value their combined effects on housing prices. To bridge this gap, this study calculates the metrics of spatial accessibility and centrality, combining street nodes, networks, and built density by land use type within walkable neighborhoods. We investigate empirically the extent to which residents value spatial accessibility and centrality to residential, commercial, office, and industrial space regarding housing prices in Seoul, South Korea in 2010. The multilevel hedonic price models used suggest that residents highly value urban settings that access larger volumes of commercial and residential buildings in densely spaced areas along dense street networks. However, homeowners respond negatively to higher access to industrial property and weakly to office space. This analysis identifies the value of spatial access to heterogeneous land-use density in housing prices and provides policy implications for land use, transportation, and urban design.},

  abstract = {Abstract---: The key differences between Russian municipalities in terms of migration increase (decrease) are determined by their position in the center-periphery system, which is most often represented with their capital/noncapital status. Most regional capitals demonstrate migration increase. The larger the capital is and the higher its migration attractiveness, the wider the areas of its intensively developing suburbs are, and the more the net increase zone that is observed in them extends. This hypothesis is tested in the article on data for 63 metropolitan areas, in 52 of which data on the new housing supply is simultaneously available. The source of data is the Rosstat database of indicators characterizing municipalities for 2014--2019, as well as the database of the shortest distances along existing roads from the centers of regional capitals to the centers of each municipal unit of the suburban zone (km). Suburbs that are 30--40 km away from the cores of metropolitan areas are characterized by significant migration increase and housing supply. Starting from a distance of 60--65 km, housing supply drops to values below the national average, and there is a steady migration decrease. The larger the population in the cores of the metropolitan areas is, the farther away these borders are from them. With increasing distance from regional capitals, per capita housing construction as well as the number of municipal units with net increase and the proportion of the population living in them are declining. A high migration increase in peri-urban areas is based on a limited number of municipalities with its ultra-high values that develop standard multi-story housing. They are located in close proximity to the capitals and their initial population is usually relatively small. An analysis of housing construction and migration rates in regional capitals and suburban municipal units indicates that the near suburbs represent an extension of regional capitals beyond their administrative boundaries providing opportunities for extensive territorial and population growth. {\copyright} 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

It is necessary to develop policies for evaluation of the urban infrastructure performance and determining the proper time of maintenance and rehabilitation activities to increase system productivity and expand the system's efficient performance time. In this paper, an algorithm is developed to evaluate the efficiency of urban water infrastructure performance, broken down into costs and benefits, and to determine the optimal time of water distribution network (WDN) rehabilitation using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm is examined in a real water distribution network in Iran. Considering different break scenarios, the WDN's performance within the projected performance period is simulated. The efficiency of the WDN is quantified using a reliability-based indicator, and costs and benefits of its performance are also evaluated. Based on the estimated reliability of the WDN and its calculated revenue, the actual remaining operation period of infrastructure is determined. A threshold of system revenue to costs ratio can be considered for determining the end of system life span; here 0.5 is considered. Based on the results in the case study, it can be concluded that the efficient lifetime of a WDN can be much less than its designed life span (here the efficient lifetime is 14-16 years, while the design life span is 20 years). The results of this study could be used efficiently in large water distribution networks to determine the rehabilitation time and avoiding the high costs of WDN failure.

  abstract = {Regarding the significant impact of thermal comfort on users' attendance in urban parks, there is an intense interest in studies on the outdoor thermal comfort in parks especially in regions with hot summers. This research examines the determinant factors of thermal environment and also strategies related to albedo and greenery in a medium-scale park using ENVI-met software. In this regard, the environmental situation is analyzed using air (Ta) and surface temperature (Ts), wind speed (WS), sky view factor (SVF), the mean radiant temperature (MRT), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET). Subsequently, low- and high-albedo pavements, plane and pine trees, and Buxus shrubs strategies are investigated that can significantly influence the parameters. According to the results, SVF is not a precise indicator for determining radiation exposure and thermal comfort conditions despite its wide application in previous studies. Further, there is a significant correlation between SVF and PET only during sunlight and sunset. In addition, the best thermal comfort condition can be reached by combining the low-albedo pavements, and trees with wide crowns and high trunks. The crown height from the ground is an important factor due to its effect on the airflow that can also counteract the impact of slightly increased radiation. Field investigation and simulation studies reveal that the effect of albedo on thermal comfort is lower than the vegetation coverage. Nevertheless, the significant changes in albedo values and urban heat island mitigation do not have any considerable effect on thermal comfort improvement in urban parks. (C) 2020 The Authors.

To ensure maximum impact, simulation-driven microclimate analysis methods must be integrated early in the design process. With Eddy3D, we present a toolkit to simulate outdoor thermal comfort metrics with a decoupled approach. We motivate the decoupled systems framework with meteorological measurements and local and global sensitivity analyses of three different climates. For a real-world case study on a university campus, we present results for both wind velocity and mean radiant temperature simulations. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a decoupled simulation approach that considers design aiding for the architectural practice. Our findings support reduced simulation time and flexibility, with the caveat of reduced accuracy due to neglecting forced convection, albeit this being less relevant in the early stages of design.

Moreover, urban densification process exerts stress on buried water infrastructure (BWI) performance. In this study, the need of predicting the change in urban densification and its subsequent impacts on BWI performance over time has drawn attention to conduct a temporal analysis. A hybrid approach was used to select the significant control performance indicators (CPIs) and conduct a temporal analysis. Eight scenarios were generated using the Canadian Council of the Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index approach to address the change in drinking water quality. The proposed approach was implemented in a municipality of British Columbia, Canada, as a case study. The results showed a 40 \% decrease in the BWI performance due to the urban areas have rapidly grown both in population and built-up areas over three decades. Furthermore, an ideal situation was assumed to show that the targeted service level (i.e., 0.5) can be achieved with 3 \% to 5 \% improvement in every five years of service level. These findings will assist the decision makers to understand the linkage between CPIs to maintain and achieve the required BWI performance.}

In the pursuit of striking the balance between these two, often conflicting mandates, the expansion of services in LIAs has been lagging behind. Typically, the expansion of services to these areas is associated with low collection rates, vandalism of infrastructure or unorderly urbanization. Using the case of two pro-poor units in Nakuru and Kisumu, Kenya, this research analyses the impact of these interventions in the operational performance of the utility. The utilities have been able to increase coverage while reducing non-revenue water (NRW) and improving collection efficiency. We realize, as others have earlier indicated, that these achievements are reached as the utility has opted for a differentiated level of service that prevents dwellers of LIAs accessing higher levels of services such as household connections. These interventions should not be seen as an end-state of water service provision in these areas. However, these pro-poor units seem a valid strategy for the utility to fulfil these mandates for the time being. {\copyright} IWA Publishing 2018.}

This goal is particularly important in global cities where public places are shared with diverse communities. The successful design of shared, sustainable, and comfortable public places is, therefore, key to an inclusive and resilient urban future. Thermal comfort levels have proven to be a pre-requisite to the successful usage of public places, given their significant effect on their users' experience. However, in global multicultural cities, providing thermally comfortable public places is challenged by the diversity of their users. This paper aims to identify the effect of cultural diversity and climatic background of urban places' users on both their thermal perceptions and comfort levels. Field measurements were conducted in parallel to structured questionnaire and observations to interlink the empirical micrometeorological data with the subjective human assessments. The field empirical measurements took place during summer and winter alongside a total of 2123 valid questionnaires and observations at two selected case studies in Melbourne, Australia. Statistically significant variations in thermal sensation votes and thermal adaptation factors were found to be related to the users' cultural and climatic backgrounds. These findings showed the effect of the users' cultural and climatic background on their thermal sensation votes, and, thus that it is crucial for these parameters to be taken into consideration while designing urban places within multicultural communities. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Urban livability seeks to improve living conditions of current and future outdoor users and hence it has become a key priority for cities authorities. Melbourne, as the world second most livable city, sets out to improve its urban life quality through various policies and initiatives. One area of improvement is the creation of sustainable outdoor spaces that provides comfortable thermal conditions for its residents. The relevant strategies to create such spaces are supported by the knowledge of human thermal comfort requirements, particularly during the summer thermal conditions. Hence, this study aims to develop comprehensive thermal comfort benchmarks for Melbourne during the summer. This study builds on 4717 subjective survey responses collected in seven urban environments with different settings. Data collection was performed in Melbourne's summer from 2012 to 2015. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was used to predict thermal comfort conditions. The results were based on four thermal comfort measures (neutral temperature, preferred temperature, acceptable thermal range and thermal comfort range). The analysis' outcomes suggested that Melbourne's summer acceptable thermal range is between 11.3 {$^\circ$}C and 20.3 {$^\circ$}C, the preferred temperature value is 21.5 {$^\circ$}C, the neutral temperature value is 16.1 {$^\circ$}C. Furthermore, PET index was calibrated against thermal responses collected from the surveys. The results would help to inform policies aiming to create sustainable outdoor spaces that are pleasant to outdoor users in Melbourne. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3 km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260 km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. {\copyright} 2021, Societ{\`a} Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).},

The current work suggests a modeling approach for developing the water balance of a network spatio-temporarily, in hour time -scale and neighborhood granularity. It exploits already established key performance indicators and introduces some new ones to highlight the potential in improving the management of a water distribution network when having a detailed spatio-temporal supervision, especially when the spatial and temporal conditions are variable. The methodology is applied in a seasonally touristic and hilly case study. Additionally, a pressure management scheme is applied to further exploit the potential of such a toolkit. For the investigated case study, the town of Skiathos, the annual real losses are estimated equal to 50.9-52.2\% of the system input volume, while apparent losses are estimated to be about 5.6-6.6\%. Losses depict intense seasonal variability. Real losses range from 38.8-39.6\% in summer months to 63.3-64.7\% in winter months, while apparent losses range from 8.4-9.3\% in summer to 1.3-2.5\% in winter. Annual water theft is estimated to be at least 3.6\% of system input volume. Spatial variability, which is linked to the elevation and the different urban land uses is proven to play a significant role in the neighborhoods' water balances and various key performance indicators are suggested and applied for the pressure control scheme. The annual potential savings due to the applied scheme rise up to 51,300 m(3) for leakage and 53,730 m(3) for pressure-driven demand.},

There are three key findings: (1) the main variation value of indicators has evolved from the quantity of housing supply to the quality of population growth, improving the quality of population growth has been the key factor to break the insufficient balance of indicators; (2) the coupling degree is high but the coordination degree is obviously low, the aggregation level of coupling coordination degree is generally middle, and there is obviously spatial polarization---improving the degree of coordination is the key point to break the inadequate balance of cities; (3) the coupling coordination degree is irregularly distributed in 11 urban agglomerations, the spatial correlation of coupling coordination degree is generally weak, improving the spatial coordination degree of urban agglomeration will contribute to improving the balanced sufficiency level, and the spatial coupling coordination degree is also expected to increase.

  abstract = {In the Netherlands, municipalities and other sub-national governments have to conduct climate stress tests to examine the societal impact of heat load by citizens. So far, these parties have been hindered by the abundance of contrasting urban heat maps produced with different metrics and methods by different agencies. To unify the stress tests, we present a methodology for a standardized urban heat map at 1-m spatial resolution by selecting the Physical Equivalent Temperature (PET) as metric for heat stress. First we present an empirical regression model for PET, based on a variety of weather data and street configurations in the human thermal energy balance model Rayman. Thereafter, this empirical PET-model is evaluated for the midsized town Wageningen (the Netherlands). Meteorological observations taken at a nearby reference site and straightforward geographical data have been used as model input. Also, established methods were applied and elaborated to account for the urban heat island effect and wind speed reduction in the city. The presented method is validated against bike traverse observations of PET. Wind speed is the most challenging feature to map, due to its unsteady and local behaviour in cities. As a result, an afternoon averaged PET heat map is demonstrated as standard for an extreme heat day (1:1000 summer half year days), and a cumulative exceedance PET heat map for a representative year. Furthermore, a heat map is projected for 2050 according a warm climate change scenario.},

Statistical estimates of housing affordability indicators in Russia generally and in major Russian metropolitan areas specifically show trends of substantial increase for the past 15 years. Although the housing affordability indicators are imperfect measures of actual levels, they are useful for monitoring trends. The affordability indicator trend in Russia differs from similar indicators for other countries. The main influencing factors for growth in housing affordability in Russia include a reduction in real housing prices, which declined faster than per capita real income, and a decrease in mortgage interest rates. Moreover, market housing pricing is influenced by housing supply. Nonetheless, extending the potential of housing affordability through lower interest rates has been largely exhausted, and further housing affordability may be achieved by increasing the stock and tenure types of affordable housing, including affordable renting. {\copyright} 2020 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.},

Herein we explore the interactions between property tax components and key socioeconomic indicators in urban economies. In particular, we report how changes in house prices, household incomes, and employment affect the interactions among assessed values, levies, collections, and property tax revenues. The stylized model we develop presents how, through property tax levies, valuations, and collection rates, property tax revenues are impacted. To correct for endogeneity among the variables, we use seemingly unrelated regressions and three-stage least squares estimators. The dataset includes financial indicators for the 147 largest American cities collected from 2003-2012. Results show that during recessions, declining house prices reduce assessed valuations, and reduced tax collection rates further compound this negative fiscal effect. The inelastic response of tax revenues to assessed values suggests that jurisdictions take back the difference by re-setting millage rates. Because each part of the levying and collecting process is very sensitive to the economic environment, revenue estimation for large cities becomes more difficult during recessions. {\copyright} 2021 International Association of Assessing Officers.

The ecological context of the organization of urban space refers to overcoming stressful climatic anomalies, which determines the preservation of areas with green plants, which become islands of freshness and comfort for citizens. The comfort of the urban environment is invested in understanding the improvement of health and recreation centers. In fact, all available areas with green plants (with the exception of those set aside for the protection zones of industrial and strategically important objects) become recreational areas of Kyiv: parks, forest and meadows parks, public squares and home grounds, strips of green plants along transport arteries such as boulevards and rest islands on the roads. Simple methods and procedures of GIS, satellite data of remote sensing of the earth's surface allow monitoring of the urban environment for the purpose of its improvement and safety. The object of this research is the territory of the city of Kyiv for the purpose of GIS analysis of urban environmental characteristics of the city environment. Visualization of NDVI and LST indicates significant spatial differences in temperature distribution: Kyiv's thermal contrasts are caused by the variegation of the earth's surface. Land cover types correlate with the functions of city spaces. The highest temperature indicators are characterized by zones connected by continuous construction, industrial use, transport junctions, which is related to their emission properties than types of vegetation covers. At the same time, areas with vegetation, especially natural forests and water bodies, have reduced temperature indicators, which generally improves the urban microclimate. {\copyright} 2022 EAGE.

The physical features of outdoor spaces are critical in determining outdoor thermal comfort through changes in meteorological parameters. Past studies comparing subjective thermal perception between local climate zones (LCZ) were mainly conducted in humid subtropical regions. This study aims to investigate this relationship using outdoor thermal comfort survey data collected in three research projects in Melbourne, Australia (temperate oceanic climate) (n = 4717). The physical features investigated included the sky view factor (SVF) and LCZ classification. During Melbourne's summer, people preferred a higher PET value than neutral PET across all LCZs. People in urban green spaces (LCZs B and C) were more likely to feel `neutral' when Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was 15.5 {$^\circ$}C--24.5 {$^\circ$}C and less likely to feel `slightly warm to hot' when PET was 24.6 {$^\circ$}C--55.6 {$^\circ$}C. Furthermore, LCZ 6 (LCZ C) reported the highest (lowest) percentage of unacceptable votes. Cluster analysis identified two thermal comfort patterns (neutral and warm groups) representing various thermal sensations and preferences. The thermal comfort patterns proportion differed between built LCZs (5, 6) and land cover LCZs (B, C). Logistic regression revealed that PET values and urban morphology (i.e., LCZ) contributed significantly to people's thermal sensations and acceptability for neutral and warm groups. SVF significantly predicted the thermal sensation and acceptability for the warm group but not the neutral group. Our study approach informs further research to understand the implications of urban design in outdoor spaces using thermal comfort patterns as a benchmark. {\copyright} 2023},

  abstract = {Energy demand for urban water supply is emerging as a significant issue. This work undertakes a multi city time-series analysis of the direct energy use for urban water supply. It quantifies the energy use and intensity for water supply in 30 cities (total population of over 170 million) and illustrates their performance with a new time-based water-energy profiling approach. Per capita energy use for water provision ranged from 10 kWh/p/a (Melbourne in 2015) to 372 kWh/p/a (San Diego in 2015). Raw water pumping and product water distribution dominate the energy use of most of these systems. For 17 cities with available time-series data (between 2000 and 2015), a general trend in reduction of per capita energy use for water provision is observed (11\%-45\% reduction). The reduction is likely to be a result of improved water efficiency in most of the cities. Potential influencing factors including climate, topography, operational efficiency and water use patterns are explored to understand why energy use for water provision differs across the cities, and in some cities changes substantially over time. The key insights from this multi-city analysis are that i) some cities may be considered as benchmarks for insight into management of energy use for water provision by better utilising local topography, capitalising on climate events, improving energy efficiency of supply systems, managing non-revenue water and improving residential water efficiency; ii) energy associated with non-revenue water is found to be very substantial in multiple cities studied and represents a significant energy saving potential (i.e. a population-weighted average of 16 kWh/p/a, 25\% of the average energy use for water provision); and iii) three Australian cities which encountered a decade-long drought demonstrated the beneficial role of demand-side measures in reducing the negative energy consequences of system augmentations with seawater desalination and inter-basin water transfers.

This is characterized by a prominent difference in the temperatures of the urban and its surrounding rural and less urbanized areas. Temperature differences occur within these UHI's indicating the existence of intra-urban heat islands (IUHI). UHI's and IUHI's are well-documented indicators of urban environmental degradation and therefore puts the population of Metro Manila at risk. In anticipation of these effects, their detection and the characterization of their behaviour through time can contribute to proper urban planning thus mitigating harmful effects. Google Earth Engine was used to retrieve land surface temperatures (LST) from Landsat data from 1997 to 2019 using emissivity estimation. The Local Moran's I statistic was then used to identify cluster and outlier types (COT). A histogram with 10 bins representing the net COT frequencies per barangay was then used to identify IUHI's. Annual temperature measurements and COT areas were plotted against time and based on linear-fit trend lines they characterize the study area as to having an annual increase in temperature of roughly 0.18 {$^\circ$}C and hotspot area extent of around 0.03 km2, and a decrease in coldspot area extent around 0.01 km2. Hotspots were found to be frequent in the cities of Caloocan, Manila, Pasay, and Quezon while coldspots were found to be frequent in the cities of Caloocan, Las Pi{\~n}as, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela. In conclusion, IUHI's were detected with statistical basis, both spatially and temporally. {\copyright} 2020 Authors.},

The local climate zone (LCZ) classification system aims to characterise the urban and rural land cover based on various urban morphological parameters. It has been widely used in studies of the thermal environment, but the subjective thermal perception between LCZ classes has rarely been studied. This study evaluated the microclimatic conditions and subjective perception of the thermal environment in eight LCZs in Hong Kong, using questionnaire surveys and field measurements. An ANOVA test showed that the microclimatic conditions were significantly different across eight LCZs, and this could be attributed to the urban morphology and the geometry of the outdoor urban spaces. This does not only affect the critical conditions but also the variations in the thermal environment. The highest maximum temperature (38.9 {$^\circ$}C) was found in LCZ 1, and the lowest maximum temperature (29.9 {$^\circ$}C) was observed in land cover LCZs. Subjective assessment showed that compact or high-rise settings were associated with warmer thermal sensations reported by the respondents. The relationship between the level of thermal stress and subjective thermal sensation changed across LCZs. This study demonstrated that the LCZ classification provides a characterisation of both the physical and thermal environment. It is also one of the first attempts to examine the relationship between the thermal environment and subjective perceptions using the LCZ classification system. Further work is required to investigate how thermal comfort indicators can be used to represent the thermal comfort conditions in different LCZs. {\copyright} 2019},

Later simple and multiple regression equations are constructed. The conditions under which and how strongly housing affordability/wages/unemployment can influence population migration decisions have been identified in the analysis. Higher affordability of housing/wages is positively related to the number of people who moved to a certain Lithuanian city from other places in Lithuania per year.

The data is used to analyse the UHI (as defined in this study) of these 100 cities, using a dedicated indicator that is suitable for comparison across Europe. The UHI indicator is found to be correlated to both meteorological and urban characteristics. Using a statistical model, the current and potential cooling of green infrastructure and soil unsealing in the 100 cities is quantified. The Europe-wide current impact of these climate adaptation measures on the UHI indicator is found to range between 0.03 and 1.82 {$^\circ$}C (with an average value of 0.45 {$^\circ$}C), which is significant compared to the UHI indicator values ranging between 0.57 and 2.54 {$^\circ$}C (with an average value of 1.43 {$^\circ$}C). Nevertheless, a large potential for extra cooling from such measures is found to remain in many cities, ranging between 0 and 1 {$^\circ$}C, with the Europe-wide average value being 0.49 {$^\circ$}C, slightly higher than the estimated current cooling. {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

  abstract = {This data-paper presents and describes a consolidated, harmonized, internationally comparable database to quantify the impacts of the housing affordability crisis. Local harmonized indicators allow to examine the unequal spatial patterns of housing affordability across a selection of European cities. This study seeks at informing and mapping the increased and unequal affordability gap, a critical issue for social cohesion and sustainability in metropolitan areas in Europe. We characterize affordability with measures of price (property and rent) and income in a selection of European Functional Urban Areas (FUAs). The methodological goal was to cope with a data gap, i.e. a lack of harmonized spatial data to map and analyze affordability in Europe. This research, conducted in 2018-19 by a European consortium for the ESPON agency, covers 4 countries and one cross-border region: Geneva (Switzerland), Annecy-Annemasse, Avignon and Paris (France), Madrid, Barcelona and Palma de Majorca (Spain) and Warsaw, {\L}{\'o}d{\'z} and Krakow (Poland). We bring insights on how institutional data (i.e. transactions data), can be bridged with unconventional data (``big data'' harvested on line) to provide a cost-effective and harmonized data collection effort that can contribute to compare affordability within cities (between neighborhoods) and across cities, using various geographical levels (1km square-grid, municipalities, FUA). We present the structure of the database, how it has been constructed in a reproducible manner; we document the validation process, the strengths and limitations of the data provided, and document the reproducibility of the workflow. {\copyright} 2021 Authors.

Here with the Paris area as a case study, three products were selected for their comparable spatial resolution of 1 km, their daily frequency, and a minimum 15-year time period with substantial common overlap: the MODIS products for land surface temperature (2000--2016), daily maps of minimum and maximum 2-m air temperatures (2000--2017) based on a statistical method of spatialization, and the COMEPHORE analysis for precipitation (1997--2012). Several spatialized indicators were used to monitor the urban climate and its impact on local climate. The intensity and spatial extent of both the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and the urban heat island of urban canopy layer (UHI), as well as the effect of the city on precipitation, were characterized. Based on these indicators, a climatological study was made for the Paris urban area and its surroundings. The comparison of (S)UHI climatologies showed that both phenomena (qualified by their intensity and spatial extent) have comparable seasonalities and orders of magnitude at night. The maximum intensity is reached in July, with more than 60},

The case study is based on field data collected in a low-income community called August Town, located in Jamaica's capital city of Kingston. A semi-formal survey was used to document how different socio-economic factors influenced household-level water accessibility within the study area. Data from the survey was later used to develop the WAI. The index revealed the importance of incorporating socio-economic and human-centered factors in the measurement of water accessibility, especially when access to improved drinking water sources is already gained. When used on its own, piped water coverage was found to be an inadequate indicator of water accessibility within the study area. In general, we regard the WAI as a useful management tool for tracking household-level and inter-community disparities, which could contribute greatly in facilitating improvements in water access where it is needed the most. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for urban form optimization to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effect under the background of global climate change and urbanization. However, there is still a lack of understanding about how the relationship between urban form and UHI intensity changes under diverse urbanization contexts. This study aims to show the change patterns of the relationship between urban form and UHI intensity along the urban development gradient based upon the investigation of a total of 150 urban areas in the Jing-Jin-Ji region in China in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. We defined a comprehensive urban development index taking into account the size of urban area, population density and night light intensity to classify the different levels of urban development. A multi-model comparison was carried out to validate the results. We found that the increase in urban continuity, sprawling, scale and density all enhanced UHI effect at the regional scale. However, the relationship between urban form indicators and UHI intensity demonstrated two opposite patterns along the urban development gradient: population density, geometric complexity and continuity, and general vegetation index of a city were found to be increasingly influential, while night light intensity, geometric elongation and forest coverage presented declining influence. Finally, the study obtained an ascending contribution rate curve for urban geometry indicators, a convex curve for urban size indicators and a declining curve for urban vegetation. These changes along the urban development gradient may be closely related to the changes of the microclimate in cities due to land use, social and economic activities in different urban development stages. The findings can contribute to more appropriate and effective urban planning in countries and regions undergoing rapid urbanization as a valuable reference. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite surface UHIs (SUHIs) with fine spatial distribution, UHIs have many advantages, more continuous temporal patterns, more relevant to people's feelings, and better thermal interaction between adjacent areas. Furthermore, the incomplete overlap between SUHI and UHI patterns within a city likely causes inconsistent research results and even influences urban-planning decisions. This paper conducted a six-day gridding field measurement of UHI intensity (UHII) in Guangzhou in autumn to comprehend its spatiotemporal pattern, to determine its response radius with urban-construction indicators and the accordingly magnitude of their interaction, and to recommend critical urban-construction indicators on a block scale. Results show that the hourly UHII at a given period cannot reflect the daily UHII. The optimal interpretation radius of UHII was up to 100 m, thus implying strong interactions within these buffer zones. The larger the block scale, the more consideration should be given to the influence of configuration of the internal landscape on UHII; the smaller the block scale, the more consideration should be on the surrounding landscape. Based on regression analysis, concrete coverage and tree coverage were the most vital urban construction indicators on the block scale, followed by sky view factor, site coverage, and waterbody coverage.},

Few studies have systematically analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of different light levels and surface temperatures. In this study, a LST NTL rank correlation model was constructed based on MOD11C3 and DMSP/OLS data to analyze the characteristics and trends of the relationship between LST and NTL, during both daytime and nighttime over China in 2012. The findings revealed a strong positive correlation between NTL level and 1ST, with the peak correlation (R-2 {\textquestiondown} 0.85) observed during July September, which indicated that, with the increase of the light intensity, the LST has an overall upward trend. The trend was relatively more stable during nighttime (variation range of R-2 was 0.3) than during daytime (variation range of R-2 was 0.44). Moreover, it was greatly enhanced without considering NTL intensity saturation pixels in the NTL partition system, and was further improved after removing pixels from urban centers, which was particularly evident at nighttime. This provided evidence that NTL intensity can be a good indicator for the distribution of urban thermal environment, particularly outside the urban centers.},

The urban heat island (UHI) effect has exacerbated urban heat waves with serious consequences for urban energy and residents' health. Therefore, a better understanding of the dynamics of the UHI effect and the influencing factors is needed in the context of carbon neutrality and global warming. This study used long-term observation and statistical data to investigate the urban heat island intensity (UHII) over the past 39 years (1981--2019) and to analyze the temporal changes of the UHI effect and the relationship between the UHI effect and indicators of rapid urbanization in Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that Zhengzhou is warming 2.2-times faster than the global land warming trend of about +0.9 {$^\circ$}C from 1981 to 2019. There is a clear phase characteristic of the heat island effect in Zhengzhou, and it offers a rapid upward trend after 2000 and a positive correlation with the urbanization process; it was found that the social and economic conditions of urban expansion in Zhengzhou have a significant relationship with UHII. We also found that the denser the urban built-up area, the more obvious the heat island effect. Compared with other countries, the influence of national policies on urban development is an indirect factor influencing the change of UHI specifically for Chinese cities. This research could provide a reference for understanding the temporal dynamics of UHI in an expanding large city for sustainable urban planning and mitigating urban warming and environmental problems. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI), referring to higher temperatures in urban extents than its surrounding rural regions, is widely reported in terms of negative effects to both the ecological environment and human health. To propose effective mitigation measurements, spatiotemporal variations and control machines of surface UHI (SUHI) have been widely investigated, in particular based on the indicator of SUHI intensity (SUHII). However, studies on SUHI frequency (SUHIF), an im-portant temporal indicator, are challenged by a large number of missing data in daily land surface temperature (LST). Whether there is any city with strong SUHII and low SUHIF remains unclear. Thanks to the publication of daily seamless all-weather LST, this paper is proposed to investigate spatiotemporal variations of SUHIF, to compare SUHII and SUHIF, to conduct a pattern classifica-tion, and to further explore their driving factors across 305 Chinese cities. Four main findings are summarized below: (1) SUHIF is found to be higher in the south during the day, while it is higher in the north at night. Cities within the latitude from 20{\textopenbullet} N and 40{\textopenbullet} N indicate strong intensity and high frequency at day. Climate zone-based variations of SUHII and SUHIF are different, in particular at nighttime. (2) SUHIF are observed in great diurnal and seasonal variations. Summer daytime with 3.01 K of SUHII and 80 of SUHIF, possibly coupling with heat waves, increases the risk of heat-related diseases. (3) K-means clustering is employed to conduct pattern classification of the selected cities. SUHIF is found possibly to be consistent to its SUHII in the same city, while they provide quantitative and temporal characters respectively. (4) Controls for SUHIF and SUHII are found in significant variations among temporal scales and different patterns. This paper first conducts a comparison between SUHII and SUHIF, and provides pattern classification for further research and practice on mitigation measurements. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

Quantitative information of the spatial distributions of urban heat has become increasingly important for resilience and adaptation to climate change in cities. This study compares satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) and urban microclimate modeling-based mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) for mapping the urban heat distributions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The LST was estimated based on Landsat 8 thermal imagery with a spatial resolution of around 100 m, while the Tmrt was simulated based on high resolution LiDAR and national aerial imagery program multispectral aerial imageries with a spatial resolution of 1 m. Result shows that both LST and Tmrt show a similar general pattern of the urban heat across the study area, while the Tmrt presents much more details of the heat variations street by street and neighborhood by neighborhood. The LST tends to have a stronger relationship with the Tmrt on building roofs, which are usually not the place for human activities.

China has invested considerable effort in improving the rental housing market in recent years. To explore the asym-metric effects of the rental housing supply scale on house prices, we constructed an analysis framework for the rental and sales markets based on substitution between owning and renting. Then, we reviewed the development of China's rental housing market and used a threshold regression model to empirically study 29 large and medium-sized cities during the period 2008-2019. The results indicated that there was weak substitution be-tween owning and renting a dwelling in China's housing market. On the premise that weak substitutability cannot be changed, measures for increasing the supply of rental housing could not attract consumers to the rental housing market and thus could not curb increases in house prices. The substitution of rental housing and self -owned housing was vital for explaining the linkage between rental housing supply and housing price. Under the low substitutability regime, increasing the supply scale of rental housing caused house prices to rise significantly. Instead, in some cities with the high substitutability, increasing the supply of rental housing could lower house prices. And our findings implied that decision-makers should pay attention to irregularities in the rental market and stimulate the endogenous motivation of both supply and demand instead of relying on exogenous means.},

The findings reveal several insights: (1) The spatial dimension notably impacts second-hand green housing prices, with regional differences evident in the effects of identical variables. This suggests that policy should be locally adapted, requiring nuanced and differentiated regulatory strategies. (2) Macroeconomic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product, Per Capita Disposable Income, and residential commercial property sales, positively influence housing prices. Monitoring these economic indicators for timely policy adjustments is advised. (3) At the microeconomic level, the architectural features of second-hand green housing negatively affect prices in the northeast and southwest regions. Conversely, neighborhood characteristics negatively impact prices in the southeast coastal region but positively influence them in central and northeastern regions. These results suggest that regular assessments of neighborhood characteristics and stringent regulation of architectural features by the government are necessary to maintain housing stock quality. This research offers enhanced insights into price formation in the second-hand green housing market and presents vital evidence for precise policy formulation and sustainable real estate development. {\copyright} 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Heat index (HI) provides a proven indicator of heat stress and discomfort for the general public. The index takes the integrated effects of both temperature and humidity into account, and both factors are regulated by large-scale circulation patterns. This study examines the impacts of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) on HI over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The analysis suggests that the HI is primarily controlled by surface air temperature over the CONUS; but is negatively correlated with relative humidity in the western and Central US north of 40{$^\circ$}N. In addition, winds contribute to the variation of HI in the Midwest and the southeastern US. By regulating these meteorological parameters, the movement of the NASH western ridge significantly impacts HI over the US, especially the Southeast. When the NASH western ridge is located northwest (NW) of its climatological mean position, abnormally high temperatures are observed due to fewer clouds and a precipitation deficit, leading to positive HI anomalies over the southeastern US. In contrast, when the western ridge is located in the southwest (SW), temperature decreases and HI anomaly becomes negative over the Southeast, even though relative humidity increases east of 100{$^\circ$}W. NASH has a weaker impact on the HI when it is far from the North American continent, especially during southeast (SE) ridge years. In the future, CMIP5 models project an increase in HI over the entire CONUS, while NASH-induced HI will be weakened during the NW, SE and NE ridge years but strengthened when its ridge moves to the SW quadrant. These results suggest that future increases in heat stress are likely caused by climatological warming and NASH intensification. {\copyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Although the satellite-derived surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) is a commonly used indicator, it still needs to be determined the SUHII between urban and suburban areas due to the challenges in delineating their boundaries with changes. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the spatial explanatory variables (SEVs) and SUHII among urban and suburban areas is highly needed. Here, using the long-term satellite observations, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of SUHII in different temporal intervals (i.e. seasonal and diurnal) and the contribution of SEVs in urban and suburban areas. Our results indicate that SUHII shows predominantly increasing trend from 2012--2021 in cities of China. Despite the trends of SEVs (i.e. increasing/decreasing) being relatively consistent in both urban and suburban, the latter shows a higher proportion regarding the trends in various SEVs. Besides, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model shows that the major contributors to SUHII in urban areas are landscape shape index (LSI), patch density (PD), and the digital elevation model (DEM), while in suburban areas, those critical SEVs are LSI, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and DEM. These findings can facilitate the sustainable design of urban planning in a nature-based solution. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).

Understanding the landscape heterogeneity in UFZs may be a way to mitigate urban heat island (UHI). The region within fifth ring road in Beijing is selected as the study area. Six common UFZ types were selected to understand the effects of three types of factors (surface biophysical parameters, building form, and landscape metrics) on land surface temperature (LST). A one-way analysis of variance and geographical detector were used to express spatial heterogeneity and key influencing factors of LST in UFZ, respectively. The results indicate the following: (1) the UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST, are industrial, commercial, public service, government, high-density residential, and recreational zones. The LST of industrial and recreational zones are significantly different from other zones, but other four types of UFZ exhibited similar thermal conditions. (2) The key influencing factors of LST in UFZs differ. Surface biophysical parameters have a significant effect on all UFZs. Building form in areas of high building height and density, such as commercial and high-density residential zones, should be the focus of UHI mitigation, whereas optimizing land cover composition and spatial configuration in other UFZs is more likely to alleviate LST. In addition, the LST is determined not only by the UFZ type and internal structure, but also by the complexity and diversity. Identifying UHI mitigation sensitivity metrics within UFZ will help improve the thermal environment of urban areas and provide strategies for resisting UHI. {\copyright} 2020, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.},

Shading effects from plants and buildings also exert a considerable influence. To investigate the influence of view factors on outdoor thermal comfort in residential areas, we employed the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and view factors (SVF, TVF, BVF) as indicators to determine outdoor thermal comfort and the quantity of shaded spaces. Thermal measurements collected from 13 points in Guangzhou, China, Our findings revealed that high TVF points exhibited more stable air temperature throughout the daytime, with average temperature differentials ranging 0.4--1.9 {$^\circ$}C lower than other points. Air temperature demonstrated a positive correlation with SVF (R2 = 0.53), while exhibiting a negative correlation with TVF (R2 = 0.45). Additionally, shading provided by plants and buildings manifests heterogeneity. At similar SVF levels, points predominantly shaded by plants (TVF {\textquestiondown} BVF) showcased lower Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) and PET compared to points shaded mainly by buildings (BVF {\textquestiondown} TVF). The maximum reduction in air temperature and PET reached 1.1 {$^\circ$}C and 1.2 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. BVF exerted greater influence earlier in the morning, as solar altitude angle rises, the average thermal parameters of sites with BVF {\textquestiondown} TVF escalated rapidly until eventually surpassing sites with TVF {\textquestiondown} BVF. Last, superior thermal conditions were only ensured under high shading conditions. When the effective shading ratio of plants and buildings diminished (SVF {\textquestiondown} 0.3), the microclimate of measurement points might be impacted by the long-wave radiation from the underlying surface. {\copyright} The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology 2024.},

  abstract = {Spatial pattern of built-up areas can exert an important influence on surface urban heat islands (SUHIs). While previous studies relied heavily on landscape indicators to characterize land use spatial pattern, such quantitative indicators cannot correspond to distinct spatial positions. By comparison, morphological spatial pattern analysis is an appealing alternative for measuring land use pattern as it can spatially visualize various land use elements from the perspective of mathematical morphology. Therefore, this research moves a step forward in understanding the spatio-temporal connection between the morphological characteristic of built-up areas and SUHI intensity. Taking a largely-urbanized city as an example, we first analyzed the SUHI intensity and morphological characteristic of built-up areas according to multi-temporal remote sensing data. Second, we used the Pearson correlation test and random forest regression to explore the linear and non-linear connections between SUHI intensity and various influence factors, respectively. Compared with landscape pattern, land use morphological characteristic plays a more important role in urban thermal environments. Both the correlation test and random forest regression suggested that the proportion of ``core'' was a dominant influence factor of the SUHI. The SUHI intensity in the study area was positively connected to the proportions of core, edge, and bridge of built-up areas, but negatively connected to the proportion of islet. Our results can help urban planners emphasize the influence of morphological characteristic in an earlier phase of thermal environment design. This assessment workflow can also be reused for various climatic factors in other cities because of its flexibility. {\copyright} 2023},

By integrating remote sensing and geospatial big data, this work aims to reveal the divergent mechanism behind Urban Heat Island (UHI) across UFZs taking insights from 2D/3D urban morphology. The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) indicator depicting 3D building distribution was introduced and integrated with the classic indicators. Their impacts on UHI were measured by ensemble learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model. Taking Wuhan as the study area, the eighteen 2D/3D urban morphology indicators affecting UHI in different locations and UFZs were extensively examined and compared. The results reveal that: 1) The impact of 2D/3D urban morphology indicators on UHI significantly varies across different UFZs, with dominance in transportation zones exhibiting opposite polarity compared to the other types; 2) positive impacts have a decreasing trend from the urban center to the edge, while negative impacts exhibit opposite trend; 3) XGBoost outperforms other classic methods in interpreting the impact of urban morphology on UHI for all UFZ types. The findings improving knowledge of UHI across UFZs will provide a practical guide for urban planning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Land use pattern can substantially shape urban thermal environment. Although previous studies have shown that urban heat island (UHI) intensity will be easily affected by the landscape pattern of green space, the relationship between the morphological spatial pattern of green space and UHI intensity remains to be discovered. Compared with landscape pattern, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) can reveal more specific details on the configuration and composition of land use. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether the morphological spatial pattern of land use matters to UHI using machine learning methods. Firstly, the morphological characteristics of green space were analyzed based on MSPA. Secondly, the linear associations between UHI intensity and a set of potential influencing factors (including morphological characteristics) were measured according to correlation coefficient. Lastly, the non-linear contribution of the morphological factors to UHI intensity was quantified based on random forest. An empirical case study in a rapidly-urbanized city has revealed the huge influence of morphological characteristics on UHI intensity with benchmark factors considered. The UHI intensity was negatively correlated with the cores, perforations, and loops of green space, but positively correlated with islets. Therefore, a few large core areas would be better than a large number of small islets when the total amount of green space is fixed. In addition, the fragmented patches of green space should be integrated or connected to enhance the cooling capacity. Our findings could offer some insights for UHI mitigation and land use planning, especially when the size of green space cannot be unlimitedly increased. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Location choice is subject to a variety of factors and the influence of housing prices is usually considered. Soaring housing prices would have a dual effect on the willingness to work and live in a particular city. Using multinomial logit models based on the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), this study examines the spatialtemporal influence of housing prices on college graduates' job city selection. It concludes that while housing costs in the workplace can have an attractive effect, these intentions to work in large cities will wane as long as housing costs remain high. Before the tipping point of housing prices, cities with higher housing prices, which are considered to offer better employment and public service prospects, might draw considerable inflows of graduates. After exceeding the tipping point, rising housing prices gradually stifled college students' influx. Hometown housing prices serve as an essential benchmark for college graduates' city choices. This study emphasizes the critical need for housing price stabilization and inclusive housing policies such as the provision of affordable housing and subsidized talent housing to attract and retain talent groups.},

The paper uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to address this gap by proposing a prediction model of city plans and corresponding LST heat maps. Taking New York City as an example, we use the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat Surface Temperature data, and other relevant data to build seven hundred image pairs as the training set to train the model of predicting LST distribution. Using untrained pairs as the test set, the model can generate LST maps relatively quickly and accurately with the input of city plans. Then after accuracy analysis, different scenarios are simulated to test the application of the model in predicting the environmental impacts of plan modifications on land surface temperature. Eventually, the principles proposed in this paper can be applied to the development of relevant interactive design and planning tools in the future.},

  abstract = {Many cities are experiencing increases in extreme heat because of global temperature rise combined with the urban heat island effect. The heterogeneity of urban morphology also leads to fine-scale variability in potential for heat exposure. Yet, how this rise in temperature and local variability together impacts urban residents differently at exposure-relevant scales is still not clear. Here we map the Universal Thermal Climate Index, a more complete indicator of human heat stress at an unprecedentedly fine spatial resolution (1 m), for 14 major cities in the United States using urban microclimate modeling. We examined the different heat exposure levels across different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups in these cities, finding that income level is most consistently associated with heat stress. We further conducted scenario simulations for a hypothetical 1 degrees C increase of air temperature in all cities. Results show that a 1 degrees C increase would have a substantial impact on human heat stress, with impacts that differ across cities. The results of this study can help us better evaluate the impact of extreme heat on urban residents at decision-relevant scales.},

  abstract = {Surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) widely acknowledged as the primary indicator has been extensively utilized in previous SUHI spatiotemporal research. However, diverse rural definitions reported in previous studies possibly affect rural temperature and consequently lead uncertainty and incomparability to SUHII dynamics. Despite of previous efforts, there are still some issues in systematic analysis of significance and spatiotemporal variations of SUHII interpretations resulting from these different rural extents. In order to address these issues, this paper quantitvely characterized the significance and spatiotemporal dynamics of RE-induced △SUHII (Rural-extent induced SUHII variations) in 100 major cities across China mainland. Major findings are summarized in the following three aspects. First, considerable SUHII variating with rural buffers extending and majority of △SUHII exceeding 0.5 K especially in the daytime illustrated that different rural definitions can induce significant uncertainty to SUHII studies. Second, RE-induced △SUHII is found to be unevenly distributed across the study area. Moreover, dense distributions of great △SUHII in city agglomerations suggest that city is an inappropriate study object for SUHII urban-cluster research since multi-influences from aggregated urban and rural areas without clear boundaries. Third, RE-induced △SUHII experiences evident seasonal variations especially in the daytime spring and summer, and spoon-shape (peaks in the begins and ends, and bottom in the middle) buffer variations with relatively low correlations among five subdivided buffer rings. Additionally, six potential factors are selected to discuss their possible effects on △SUHII spatiotemporal characters. On the whole, this paper illustrated that diverse rural extents do induce conspicuous uncertainty and incomparability to SUHII interpretations and highlight the necessity to develop uniform rural defining standards in the future SUHII research. {\copyright} 2019},

First, based on the time-series analysis of individual cities, five regression models with gross error elimination are established between average night-time light intensity (ANLI) and average commercial residential housing price (ACRHP) adjusted by annual inflation rate or not from 2002 to 2013. Next, an optimal model is selected for predicting the ACRHPs in 2014 of these capital cities, and then verified by the interval estimation and corresponding official statistics. Finally, experimental results show that the quadratic polynomial regression is the optimal mining model for estimating the ACRHP without adjustments in most provincial capitals and the predicted ACRHP of these cities are almost in their interval estimations except for the overrated Chengdu and the underestimated Wuhan, while the adjusted ACRHP is all in prediction interval. Overall, this paper not only provides a novel insight into time-series ACRHP data mining based on time-series ANLI for capital city scale but also reveals the potentiality and mechanism of the comprehensive ANLI to characterize the complicated ACRHP. Besides, other factors influencing housing prices, such as the time-series lags of government policy, are tested and analysed in this paper. {\copyright} 2020, The Author(s).},

However, among the multiple research efforts exploring the coordination between the two aspects, the widespread urban climate change has rarely been considered. This study encompasses urban climate change into the cross-system coupling analysis framework to assess its coordination with economic growth using the Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) model. The two aspects are respectively represented using indicators of Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Specifically, China is selected as case study, and a total of 259 cities from the 2000--2015 period are analyzed. The spatio-temporal patterns of CCD are investigated through time series clustering to uncover its performance under diversified economic and climatic contexts. The regional inequality and spatial agglomeration effects are also examined. Results reveal significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity of CCD. Geographically, CCD varies from uncoordinated to high-level coordination. Wealthier cities in the eastern coastal region are significantly better coordinated than their inland counterparts. Temporally, the uptrend of CCD is not significant for most cities due to the relatively insufficient emphasis on urban heat island (UHI) mitigation in previous efforts. Evident spatial inequality and agglomeration patterns are also observed with slight downtrends. The spatio-temporal patterns of CCD revealed in this study indicate great necessity for the central government to develop policies suiting cities' special characteristics and contexts, and more efforts should be targeted on reducing regional imbalance. Hence, a nation-city-community policy skeleton is last outlined to enhance the pursuit of a more climate-friendly urban environment under rapid economic development. Overall, this study advances the understanding of economy-urban climate interactions and facilitates the future pursuit of better sustainable cities. The proposed workflow can be utilized for other countries with diversified urbanization processes and potentially used for comparison among different countries. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

An insight into the daytime urban thermal characteristics in different built-up areas is crucial for mitigating and adapting to urban overheating. In this study, we apply the WRF model with the BEP-BEM urban scheme to simulate the thermal environment of built-up areas in five representative Chinese cities during heatwave events. By employing high-resolution urban land use/land cover data based on local climate zone (LCZ) classification, we aim to examine the heterogeneous nature of the urban thermal environment. Air temperature and heat stress metrics are employed to describe the thermal environment. The model results are validated by meteorological data with a high correlation coefficient and a low centralized root mean square error of air temperature, indicating good model performance. The results indicate that air temperature is higher in compact areas (i.e., LCZ1 and LCZ2) and lower in open and sparse areas (i.e., LCZ9 and LCZ6), similar to many observational and simulation results. Meanwhile, heat stress metrics that consider both air temperature and humidity reveal minimal variation among different LCZs. When temperature, humidity, and wind speed are all considered, the heat stress metric presents characteristics that are analogous to the air temperature pattern. We further analyze the factors (i.e., anthropogenic heat, thermal parameters, and geometrical parameters) that contribute to air temperature differences between LCZs and find that anthropogenic heat and geometrical parameters are the primary contributors. Anthropogenic heat accounts for nearly three fifths of the total difference, and geometrical parameters account for more than two fifths, while thermal parameters have little effect. These findings could assist municipal planners design appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the effects of urban overheating and create a more habitable urban environment. {\copyright} 2024},

Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) is used as the thermal comfort metric, derived based on a combination of in-situ measured meteorological parameters and numerically simulated pedestrian-level radiant exchange. The numerical model is developed based on surface energy balance coupled with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique and is validated with in-situ measurements. We study the thermal comfort enhancement potential of four typical tree morphologies at varied planting densities in the residential precincts in tropical Singapore. Firstly, we examine the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of PET in a matured residential precinct (MRP) on a typical hot day. Trees with large canopies either in diameter or height, i.e., umbrella and oblong trees, are most effective in improving outdoor thermal comfort. In particular, the umbrella trees improve the precinct mean PET by 1 class from ``Warm'' to ``Slightly warm'' at 14:00. Amongst different land features, the mean reduced PET is highest on land features near trees, i.e., grass, by up to 4.35 {$^\circ$}C. Secondly, we evaluate the effects of varied planting densities in a new residential precinct (NRP), where open grass patches exist between buildings. At 14:00, tree planting densities of 2.20, 12.20, 29.33, and 36.76 trees per 10,000 m2 are needed per 1 {$^\circ$}C of mean reduced PET for umbrella, oblong, round to inverted cone trees, respectively.

Nevertheless, how UHI responds to various urban morphological patterns is still limitedly understood, especially for cities in developing countries. Here, based on 1288 urban clusters identified automatically across China, we created a consistent analytical environment to recognize both homogeneity and heterogeneity of the relationship. Specifically, urban form was characterized from aspects of size, shape, and centrality, respectively measured using metrics of urban size, area-weighted mean shape index (AWMSI) and dispersion index (DI), entropy and Moran's I. Then, relationships between the metrics and surface UHI (SUHI) were modelled using the ordinary least squares (OLS). Results reveal that in nighttime when stronger relationships were observed than in daytime, centrality, a feature of intra-urban development structure largely neglected by previous studies, dominated as the most influential aspect. The relationships also varied across climate zones. A two-step OLS regression further reveals them to be size-dependent. As city expanded, the rising shape irregularity created a cooling impact, while the rising centrality leaded to urban warming. Overall, this study suggests that, in addition to controlling urban expansion, the optimal urban form for SUHI mitigation is moderately dispersed, polycentric, and decentralized.},

  abstract = {The urban water supply system environment is becoming more complicated and unpredictable than ever before in the context of global climate change and expanding urbanization. Existing studies have adopted either static or dynamic approaches to assess the resilience of water supply systems without combining the two. Previous literature mostly establishes rigid quantitative metrics for resilience assessment, often without depicting the dynamics and adaptability of system resilience. For example, these studies usually fail to provide a critical point for identifying system resilience. To accurately describe the dynamics and adaptability of water supply system resilience under uncertain scenarios, in this study, we constructed a comprehensive framework based on the qualitative assessment of the input parameters, combining static and dynamic assessment, with the latter playing a dominant role based on the system perspective of pressure-state-influence-response. Taking Qingdao as a case study, we combined this framework with the system resilience theory, and statically assessed the five types of capitals and three attributes of resilience with the capital portfolio approach (CPA). Then, we dynamically assessed the resilience of urban water supply systems and identified critical points with the dynamic socio-technical model coupled with system resilience and the fitting analysis method. The results are as follows: (1) the static assessment results demonstrate an imbalanced development in the levels of the five types of capitals (financial capital, management efficiency, infrastructure, available water resources, and adaptation) and three attributes (robustness, recoverability, and adaptability) in the water supply systems of Qingdao. (2) The dynamic assessment results show that the current resilience trajectory of the water supply systems in Qingdao is that of a city in transition. (3) The fitting analysis shows that robustness (RB) has a linear relationship with resilience, recoverability (RE) has a non-linear relationship with resilience, and the critical points are RB = 0.70 and RE = 1.20. The research findings provide a reference for studying resilience mechanisms, internal attribute relationships, and resilience enhancement measures of urban water supply systems.},

Recent studies have moved beyond hedonic approaches considering housing attributes, location, and neighborhood by introducing urban structure and amenities as factors in housing prices. However, the role of amenities is often simplified, and the influence of urban structure is explored mainly using distance to CBD or concentric rings. This study more carefully examines the role of amenities in determining housing prices through a case study of Nanjing, China, adopting the self-organizing map and spatial regime modeling using remote sensing and point-of-interest data. We find that the regime of urban structure sways the hedonic factors' significance and positivity. Amenities play a double role in housing markets, as they act both as a determinant of housing price and an indicator of urban structure. Our study provides an improved framework of housing prices, which is applicable to studies of other cities.

As an important indicator of residents' willingness to live, housing prices provide valuable feedback from their perspective for improving spatial quality. Taking Wuhan as a case study, this paper constructs an indicator system with 12 explanatory variables, including a subjective evaluation of buildings generated using deep learning techniques. Using OLS and GWR models, the study analyzes the factors influencing housing prices and their spatiotemporal dynamics in Wuhan's core urban areas from 2016 to 2024, encompassing the full cycle of housing price fluctuations from an upward to a downward trend. The findings reveal that, as housing prices return to more rational levels, the impact of location factors diminishes, while the influence of community quality factors---such as property fees, green space ratio, and building quality---significantly increases. Factors such as proximity to hospitals also exhibit a certain degree of spatiotemporal complexity. This trend highlights residents' growing attention to housing quality and living environments, marking a fundamental shift in the behavior of homebuyers. The results of this study provide crucial insights into the evolution of residential preferences and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the housing market. They offer significant theoretical and practical references for understanding residents' housing needs from their perspective, thereby promoting the healthy development of the real estate market and improving urban spatial quality. {\copyright} 2025 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: House price-to-rent (P-t-R) ratios are among the most widely used measures of housing market conditions. Given the theoretical and apparent bidirectional, causal relationships and imbalances between the housing market, broader economy and financial market determinants, it is important to understand the relationship between macro- and micro-economic characteristics in relation to the P-t-R ratio to enhance the understanding of housing market dynamics. This paper studies the joint dynamics and persistence of house prices and rents and examines the temporal interactions of the P-t-R ratio and economic and financial determinants. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the lead--lag relationships between the P-t-R ratios and a spectrum of macroeconomic variables using cointegration and causality methods, initially at the aggregate position and also across housing types within the Northern Ireland housing market to establish whether there are subtle differences in how various housing segments react to changes in economic activity and market fundamentals. Findings: The findings reveal price switching dynamics and some very distinct long- and short-run relationships between macroeconomic and financial indicators and the P-t-R ratios across the various housing segments. The results exhibit monetary supply, foreign exchange markets and the stock market to be important drivers of the P-t-R ratio, with P-t-R movements seemingly tied, or are in tandem, with the overall economy, particularly with the construction sector. Practical implications: The study shows that the P-t-R ratio can be used as an early measure for establishing the effects of macroprudential policy changes and how these may manifest across housing tiers and quality, which can further act as a signal for preventing or at least mitigating future irrational price cyclicity. These insights serve to inform housing and economic policy and macroprudential policy design, principally within lending policy and the effect of regulatory interventions and further enhance the understanding of the P-t-R ratio on housing market structure and dynamics. Originality/value: This study is the first in the housing literature that examines the causal relationships between the P-t-R ratio and macroeconomic activity at the sub-market level. It investigates whether and how money supply, inflation, foreign exchange markets, general economic productivity and other important macroeconomic factors interact with the pricing of different property types over time. {\copyright} 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Tourism is one of the fastest growing economic sectors on an international scale. Based on this growth, it became necessary to consider climatic-meteorological conditions as determinants for boosting tourism in some geographical areas. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the perception of bioclimatic comfort of tourists who visited the city of Porto in the summer seasons of 2019 and 2020 (in the on-going pandemic). Primary data were obtained from a questionnaire on perceptions of bioclimatic comfort and microclimatic measurements applied to 207 tourists in the summer of 2019, 146 in the winter of 2019--2020 and 210 in the summer of 2020. It took place in one of the main places of passage for tourists visiting the city of Porto. Based on statistical analysis, responses were parameterized according to the environmental and sociodemographic characteristics of the tourists. In addition, summary indicators (Physiological Equivalent Temperature -- PET, Thermal Sensation Vote -- TSV, Thermal Preference Vote -- TPV) were used to characterize the profile of visiting tourists. The influence of microclimate conditions on the thermal comfort of tourists was evident, showing, however, that they still felt comfortable regardless of the situation. The results demonstrated a good effort to reduce thermal discomfort through adapted behavior. Air temperature and relative humidity seem to be more directly related to mean thermal sensation votes in the summer of 2019 (r2 = 0.86 and r2 = 0.68, respectively). In the winters of 2019--2020 and summer of 2020, these indicators do not show such a strong correlation. Anyway, it is verified that there is a greater tolerance for higher and lower temperatures than those that are verified for the residents, when compared to previous studies. The consideration of average thresholds for thermal comfort in tourism is crucial. In future studies and planning proposals, it will be necessary to consider the optimal climatic conditions of local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Producing more accurate and representative metrics is important as new sources of data emerge with higher frequency, detail, and volume, providing more information for policymaking, but usually come with strong sampling biases that are often overlooked. In the case of housing price indices, although the literature around its estimation is abundant, it has concentrated only in traditional and formal sources of housing data, which is normally not available in some markets (i.e. renting) and locations (developing countries). In this paper, I propose a method to create a housing price index (HPI) that is comparable in quality to the industry-standard Case-Shiller HPI but using online listing data. Using online listing data from a developing economy (Chile), this paper shows that large sampling biases present when using raw unweighted data, how these biases can be minimized using sampling weights, and how new and relevant information can be obtained from adjusted HPIs that can lead better policymaking. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2022.},

Cities are searching for ways to determine the most affected areas to begin addressing this pervasive issue. While we are living through the ``big data'' revolution, policy makers are still uncertain about what level of data is most useful. We evaluate the data loss from using data at different spatial resolutions to evaluate heat vulnerability, as both the definition of intra-urban heat and the resolution of the data affect the area identified and targeted for mitigation. Variance-based metrics provide many advantages, but when data is aggregated, these metrics are less able to represent the full range of urban heat. Using the case of Bexar County (home to San Antonio, TX), we find that increasing data aggregation increases both false positive and false negative identification of intra-urban heat islands, leading to unreliable results. Misclassification increases as aggregation increases, indicating that decisions should be made at the finest spatial resolution possible. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

The results reveal that during periods of economic expansion, housing unaffordability tended to diffuse from regions of slower economic growth to regions of higher economic development. It is further evident that in the aftermath of the GFC, the London housing market Granger-caused other regional markets in terms of housing (un)affordability. Lastly, the U.K'.s decision to leave the EU in 2016 seems to have led to more divergence between the submarket regions, which in a Granger causal sense, have become less causally correlated in terms of pricing. We conjecture that the causal interactions between the different regional housing submarkets exist with the lead--lag relationships governed primarily by their underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. {\copyright} 2023 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Purpose: The price-to-rent ratio is often regarded as an important indicator for measuring housing market imbalance and inefficiency. A central question is the extent to which house prices and rents form part of the same market and thus whether they respond similarly to parallel stimulus. If they are close proxies dynamically, then this provides valuable market intelligence, particularly where causal relationships are evident. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the relationship between market and rental pricing to uncover the price switching dynamics of residential real estate property types and whether the deviation between market rents and prices are integrated over both the long- and short-term. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses cointegration, Wald exogeneity tests and Granger causality models to determine the existence, if any, of cointegration and lead-lag relationships between prices and rents within the Belfast property market, as well as the price-to-rent ratios amongst its five main property sub-markets over the time period M4, 2014 to M12 2018. Findings: The findings provide some novel insights in relation to the pricing dynamics within Belfast. Housing and rental prices are cointegrated suggesting that they tend to move in tandem in the long run. It is further evident that in the short-run, the price series Granger-causes that of rents inferring that sales price information unidirectionally diffuse to the rental market. Further, the findings on price-to-rent ratios reveal that the detached sector appears to Granger-cause those of other property types except apartments in both the short- and long-term, suggesting possible spill-over of pricing signals from the top-end to the lower strata of the market. Originality/value: The importance of understanding the relationship between house prices and rental market performance has gathered momentum. Although the house price-rent ratio is widely used as an indicator of over and undervaluation in the housing market, surprisingly little is known about the theoretical relationship between the price-rent ratio across property types and their respective inter-relationships. {\copyright} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The rapid urbanization process has led to the gradual replacement of natural landscapes by products of socioeconomic activities, and although previous studies have shown that natural conditions and socioeconomic intensity can significantly influence land surface temperature (LST), few studies have explored the combined effects of both on LST, especially at a fine scale. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between natural conditions/socioeconomic and summer daytime LST based on big data and a random forest (RF) algorithm using the city of Jinan as the study area. The results showed that the spatial pattern of LST, natural condition characteristics of the city, and socioeconomic characteristics are consistent in spatial pattern and have significant correlation. In the RF model, the fitted R2 of the regression model considering two influencing factors reaches 0.86, which is significantly higher than that of the regression model considering only one influencing factor. In the optimal regression model, topographic factors in natural conditions and socioeconomic factors in buildings and roads are very important factors influencing the urban thermal environment. Based on the results, strategies and measures for developing and managing measures related to the thermal environment are discussed in depth. The results can be used as a reference for mitigating urban heat islands in the study area or other cities with similar characteristics. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

We then compared the reliability of the five classification methods in resolving 12-period data and the seasonal average temperature in UHI patches, based on two indicators: UHI area and UHI intensity. The actual land-use composition of the UHI patches obtained with traditional methods was applied to confirm our results. The mean-standard deviation method and natural breaks (Jenks) method were more robust with regard to UHI classification and 12-period data reliability. For the UHI area index, the mean-standard deviation method produced the smallest total area of UHI patches for summer days and nights. For the UHI intensity index, the quantile method, mean-standard deviation method, and natural breaks (Jenks) method were associated with smaller errors. Considering the composition of land-use types in UHI patches, the mean-standard deviation method, and natural breaks (Jenks) method were more rigorous. Thus, our research results provide guidance for method selection when classifying UHI. {\copyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

Understanding of the relationship between urban planning indicators and thermal environment formation makes it possible to consider the thermal environment in more detail at the planning stage, and optimize the urban planning proposal in mitigation of urban heat island effect (UHI). The primary aim of this study is to propose an analytical method for quantifying UHI in a planned urban area based on planning indicators. This study used an index called heat island potential (HIP) to evaluate UHI in an urban area, and theoretically confirmed that the total daily cumulative HIP for an urban area can be calculated using the daily cumulative HIP for all sub-areas and coverage ratios of land covers (building, pavement, trees, etc.) in the urban area. The sub-areas can be classified to two types: one with buildings, and another without buildings. The daily cumulative HIP for a sub-area with and without buildings can be estimated with regression equations in which planning indicators are variables. This paper presented how to obtain the regression equations for estimating the total daily cumulative HIP in a residential area through a case study in Nanning which is located in the south of China. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Urban planning plays an important role in the formation of urban space and microclimate. As a middle-level planning in the Chinese urban planning system, regulatory planning has a direct impact on the shaping of 3D urban space and can maximize the operability of urban planning. However, 3D space formation is not considered in the present preparation of regulatory plans, which leads to a misunderstanding of possibly formed 3D landscapes and microclimatic effects after the plan implementation. To support 3D visualization and quantitative analysis of the urban heat island effect (UHI) for regulatory planning, this study proposes a rule-based 3D modeling method to efficiently generate 3D models. The main elements of 3D models (terrain, building, road, vegetation, and land parcel) and their content were determined after analyzing the characteristics of 3D models in the regulatory plan. The 3D modeling process was constructed and combined with an UHI evaluation model through CGA programming. An index called heat island potential (HIP) was used as the UHI evaluation index and can be quantified using the correlation equations between planning indicators and HIP. The proposed method can support the planners to generate 3D models for a planning proposal, and simultaneously analyze 3D spatial effect and UHI. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).

  abstract = {More than half of the total population in China are living in cities. Especially, the people in highly developed and spatially integrated city clusters, i.e., urban agglomerations (UAs), are facing increasing human-perceived heat stress that describes the combined effects of hot temperature, high humidity, and lowered surface wind speed. By analyzing multiple indicators over 20 major UAs across China, we demonstrate that summer heat stress has been significantly intensifying in nearly all UAs during 1971--2014. This intensification is more profound in northern than southern regions and is especially stronger in more urbanized and densely populated areas (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze River Delta). Based on a dynamic classification of weather stations using time-varying land use/land cover maps, we find that urban core areas exhibit distinctly stronger increasing heat stress trends than their surrounding rural areas. On average, urbanization contributes to approximately one-quarter of the total increase in mean heat stress over urban core areas of UAs and nearly half of the total increase in extreme heat stress events. The urbanization effect is also dependent on the geographical region within China. Urbanization tends to have stronger intensifying effects on heat stress in UAs with higher population density in low-altitude areas, while it has a relatively weaker intensifying and even weakening effect in some arid and high-altitude regions. Moreover, as various heat stress metrics may yield different estimations of long-term trend and urbanization contribution, the particular choice of heat stress indicator is of critical importance for investigations on this subject matter. {\copyright} 2021.

The association between UHI effects and land cover characteristics has been extensively studied but is insufficiently understood in inland cities due to their unique urban environments. This study sought to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of the thermal environment and their relationships with land cover composition and configuration in Xi'an, the largest city in northwestern China. Land cover maps were classified and land surface temperature (LST) was estimated using Landsat imagery in six time periods from 1995 to 2020. The variations of surface heat island were captured using multi-temporal LST data and a surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) indicator. The relationship between land cover features and land surface temperature was analyzed through multi-resolution grids and correlation analysis. The results showed that mean SUHII in the study area increased from 0.683 {$^\circ$}C in 1995 to 2.759 {$^\circ$}C in 2020. The densities of impervious surfaces had a stronger impact on LST than green space, with Pearson's correlation coefficient r ranging from 0.59 to 0.97. The correlation between normalized difference impervious surface index and LST was enhanced with the enlargement of the grid cell size. The correlations between normalized difference vegetation index and LST reached maxima and stabilized at grid cell sizes of 210 and 240 m. Increasing the total area and aggregation level of urban green space alleviated the negative impacts of UHI in the study area. Our results also highlight the necessity of multi-scale analysis for examining the relationships between landscape configuration metrics and LST. These findings improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of the surface urban heat island effect and its relationship with land cover features in a major inland city of China. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.},

The cluster analysis produced impact scores with five cluster centers that grouped countries with similar key compound indicators and impact scores. Three countries (Gambia, Libya, \& Mauritius) were classified as outliers. Libya presented a unique case with the highest impact score on energy input for raw water abstraction, associated with largescale pumping from deep groundwater aquifers. Multivariate analysis of the key indicators for 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are either water-secure or water-stressed illustrate the relative impact of drivers on energy input for municipal water supply. The analytical framework developed presents an approach to assessing the impact of drivers on energy input for municipal water supply, and the findings could be used to support planning processes to build resilient drinking water infrastructure in developing countries with data challenges.},

Wet-bulb temperature (WBT), which combines temperature and humidity effects, is a useful indicator for assessing regional and global heat stress variability and trends. However, the variations of European WBT and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using observations and reanalysis datasets, we demonstrate a remarkable warming of summer WBT during the period 1958--2021 over Europe. Specifically, the European summer WBT has increased by over 1.08C in the past 64 years. We find that the increase in European summer WBT is driven by both near-surface warming temperatures and increasing atmospheric moisture content. We identify four dominant modes of European summer WBT variability and investigate their linkage with the large-scale atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature anomalies. The first two leading modes of the European WBT variability exhibit prominent interdecadal to long-term variations, mainly driven by a circumglobal wave train and concurrent sea surface temperature variations. The last two leading modes of European WBT variability mainly show interannual variations, indicating a direct and rapid response to large-scale atmospheric dynamics and nearby sea surface temperature variations. Further analysis shows the role of global warming and changes in midlatitude circulations in the variations of summer WBT. Our findings can enhance the understanding of plausible drivers of heat stress in Europe and provide valuable insights for regional decision-makers and climate adaptation planning. {\copyright} 2024 American Meteorological Society.},

Using Maxine Molyneux's conceptualization of `strategic gender needs' and `practical gender needs', the article develops gender-sensitive indicators to assess progress on four categories of urban infrastructure: water supply, sanitation, housing and public transport. It then uses the benefit incidence analysis (BIA) of public expenditure tool to arrive at expenditure benefits reaching women in both cities.

Among all cities, Wuhan is one of the most affected by these changes, accompanied by the transformation of water surfaces into urban lands and the decline of natural ventilation. This study investigated the impact of surface urban heat island enlargement (SUHI) and block morphology changes in heat balance. Accordingly, the interactive impact of building diversity with major building forms (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise) on thermal balance and microclimate changes under the influence of urban land expansion at the residential block scale was studied. To investigate the heat balance changes by air temperature intensification and air movement reduction, a long-term and field observational analysis (1980-2018) coupled with computational fluid dynamic simulation (CFD) was used to evaluate the impact of building diversity on thermal balance. Outcomes show that urban heat island intensity (UHII) increased by 2 degrees C when water surfaces in urban areas decreased; consequently, there was a deterioration in the air movement to alleviate UHII. Thus, the air movement declined substantially with UHII and SUHI enlargement, which, through increased urban surfaces and roughness length, will become worse by 2020. Furthermore, the decline in air movement caused by the transformation of urban water bodies cannot contribute to the heat balance unless reinforced by the morphology of the urban blocks. In the design of inner-city blocks, morphological indicators have a significant impact on microclimate and heat balance, where increasing building density and plot ratio will increase UHII, and increasing water surfaces will result in an increase in urban ventilation. Lastly, a substantial correlation between air temperature and relative humidity was found, which, together with the block indicators, can help control the air temperature and adjust the urban microclimate.},

The main innovation is the integrated approach between energy and water balances allowing the quantification of energy inefficiencies directly associated with water losses. Comprehensive energy performance indicators can be calculated by utilities with different maturity levels allowing a fair comparison of energy efficiency between systems with different layouts and operational schemes. This energy balance scheme has been applied by 17 water utilities in Portugal. Results have shown that systems provide more than twice the minimum energy necessary to supply their consumers and, consequently, there is a significant energy saving potential: 40\% through water loss reduction, 30\% for changes in network operation and layout and 30\% for pump inefficiency reduction. {\copyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

The method consists of applying a simulation with the ENVI-met 4.4.5 software to two scenarios: 1) asphalt road and parking areas, and 2) pedestrian path with vegetation and natural surface materials. The simulated maps present variables of air temperature, T surface, and radiant temperature to determine the level of thermal comfort calculated with the predicted mean vote index (V). The results showed a 6{$^\circ$}C difference in the surface temperature between both scenarios, and the PMV index was comfortable at 9:00, while later, at 12h and 15h, the index improved with the incorporation of vegetation and natural materials on the road surface. Similarly, through remote sensing, 5.14{$^\circ$}C was obtained as the land surface temperature (LST). These indicators spotlight the effects of the change in the urban microclimate to improved decision-making in urban design and argue for a network of pedestrian areas in the city. {\copyright} 2021 Urbani Izziv.

In this context, the implementation of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can partially reduce UHI intensity, promoting a resilient urban environment and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. In order to achieve this result, there is a need to systematically integrate UGI into urban planning and legislation, but this process is subject to the availability of widely applicable, easily accessible and quantitative evidence. To offer a big picture of urban heat intensity and opportunities to mitigate high temperatures, we developed a model that reports the Ecosystem Service (ES) of microclimate regulation of UGI in 601 European cities. The model simulates the temperature difference between a baseline and a no-vegetation scenario, extrapolating the role of UGI in mitigating UHI in different urban contexts. Finally, a practical, quantitative indicator that can be applied by policymakers and city administrations has been elaborated, allowing to estimate the amount of urban vegetation that is needed to cool summer temperatures by a certain degree. UGI is found to cool European cities by 1.07 degrees C on average, and up to 2.9 degrees C, but in order to achieve a 1 degrees C drop in urban temperatures, a tree cover of at least 16},

To help the public policy to be more efficient about Urban Heat Island (UHI) reduction we aim to define a UHI risk indicator.

All these methods are not applicable over a whole territory or cannot produce map with a fine resolution as expected.

This model is based on data of the territory (vector data and imagery analysis) and physical laws governing heat exchanges between sun, city and atmosphere; in ideal climatic conditions (anticyclonic, without winds and clouds).

  abstract = {Purpose: The studies on international housing markets have not modeled frequency domain and focused only on the time domain. The purpose of the present research is to fill this gap by using the state-of-the-art econometric technique of wavelets to understand how differences in the horizon of analysis across time impact international housing markets' relationship with some of the key macroeconomic variables. The purpose is to also analyze the direction of causation in the relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses the novel time--frequency analysis of international housing markets' linkages to the macroeconomic drivers. Unlike conventional approaches that do not distinguish between time and frequency domain, the author uses wavelets to study house prices' relationship with its drivers in the time--frequency space. The novelty of the approach also allows gaining insights into the debates that deal with the direction of causation between house price changes and macroeconomic variables. Findings: Results show that the relationship between house prices and key macroeconomic indicators varies significantly across countries, time, frequencies and the direction of causation. House prices are most related to interest rates at the higher frequencies (short-run) and per capita income growth at the lower frequencies (long-run). The role of industrial production and income growth has switched over time at lower frequencies, particularly, in Finland, France, Sweden and Japan. The stock market's nexus with the housing market is significant mainly at high to medium frequencies around the recent financial crisis. Research limitations/implications: The present research implies that in contrast to the existing approaches that are limited to the only time domain, the frequency considerations are equally, if not more, important. Practical implications: Results show that interested researchers and analysts of international housing markets need to account for the both horizon and time under consideration. Because the factors that drive high-frequency movements in housing market are very different from low-frequency movements. Furthermore, these roles vary over time. Social implications: The insights from the present study suggest policymakers interested in bringing social change in the housing markets need to account for the time--frequency dynamics found in this study. Originality/value: The paper is novel on at least two dimensions. First, to the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to propose the use of a time--frequency approach in modeling international housing market dynamics. Second, unlike present studies, it is the first to uncover the direction of causation between house prices and economic variables for each frequency at every point of time. {\copyright} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As an essential public infrastructure, a WDS plays an integral role in meeting the water needs of its users at service pressure. Hence, the service level should also be considered when reducing the energy consumption of the WDS. Therefore, to evaluate both energy management and service level, this study proposes efficient returned pressure (ERP) as a metric to optimize the WDS in both aspects by comparing the service pressure to the required energy intensity. During its operating cycle, the ERP considers the pressure and required energy intensity of the demand junctions resulting from the connection of various WDS elements. Using ERP as an optimization objective against the cost for three cases of different active network element configurations, it was discovered that ERP successfully identified solutions that could maximize service pressure while maintaining a minimum required energy intensity. Using ERP provided more effective solutions in terms of cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and network pressure uniformity compared to a conventional index such as the modified resilience index. Overall, the ERP proves to be a feasible optimization parameter when pressure and energy usage is of concern.},

  abstract = {Urban overheating and its ongoing exacerbation due to global warming and urban development lead to increased exposure to urban heat and increased thermal discomfort and heat stress. To quantify thermal stress, specific indices have been proposed that depend on air temperature, mean radiant temperature (MRT), wind speed, and relative humidity. While temperature and humidity vary on scales of hundreds of meters, MRT and wind speed are strongly affected by individual buildings and trees and vary on the meter scale. Therefore, most numerical thermal comfort studies apply microscale models to limited spatial domains (commonly representing urban neighborhoods with building blocks) with resolutions on the order of 1 m and a few hours of simulation. This prevents the analysis of the impact of city-scale adaptation and/or mitigation strategies on thermal stress and comfort. To solve this problem, we develop a methodology to estimate thermal stress indicators and their subgrid variability in mesoscale models - here applied to the multilayer urban canopy parameterization BEP-BEM within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The new scheme (consisting of three main steps) can readily assess intra-neighborhood-scale heat stress distributions across whole cities and for timescales of minutes to years. The first key component of the approach is the estimation of MRT in several locations within streets for different street orientations. Second, mean wind speed and its subgrid variability are downscaled as a function of the local urban morphology based on relations derived from a set of microscale LES and RANS simulations across a wide range of realistic and idealized urban morphologies. Lastly, we compute the distributions of two thermal stress indices for each grid square, combining all the subgrid values of MRT, wind speed, air temperature, and absolute humidity. From these distributions, we quantify the high and low tails of the heat stress distribution in each grid square across the city, representing the thermal diversity experienced in street canyons. In this contribution, we present the core methodology as well as simulation results for Madrid (Spain), which illustrate strong differences between heat stress indices and common heat metrics like air or surface temperature both across the city and over the diurnal cycle.},

In the face of challenges, like water scarcity, establishing resilient networks is imperative, especially in regions vulnerable to water crises. This study evaluates the resilience of network designs through graph theory, including its hydraulic feasibility using EPANET software, an aspect often overlooked. Novel mathematical algorithms, including Resilience by Design (RbD) and Resilience -strengthening (RS) algorithms, provide costeffective and resilient network designs, even with budget constraints. A novel metric, Water Availability (WA), is introduced to offer a comprehensive measure of network resilience, thereby addressing ongoing discrepancies in resilience evaluation methods. Practical benefits are illustrated through a case study in which a resilient -by -design reclaimed water network is created, and an existing equivalent non -resilient network is improved. The resilient -by -design network demonstrates remarkably better results compared to the equivalent non -resilient design, including up to a 36 \% reduction in the probability of service disruptions and a nearly 65 \% decrease in the annual average unserved water due to service disruptions. These findings underscore the enormous advantages of a resilience -focused network design approach. When compared to the equivalent nonresilient design, the resilient -by -design network generated effectively safeguards up to a significant 91 , 700 m 3 of water from the impacts of water disruption events over a 50 -year operational period. In addition, the resilientby -design WDN solution incurs a subtle decrease in overall costs compared to consuming tap water from the drinking WDN baseline over a 50 -year operational period. These findings highlight the cost-effectiveness of the approach, even offering financial benefits. This paper builds on our previous research by expanding its scope to include resilience considerations, providing algorithms that can be easily adapted from reclaimed to drinking WDNs. Ultimately, we contribute to the enhancement of water resource management and infrastructure planning in ever -evolving urban environments.}

Experimental and numerical results illustrate the approach in a case study of a French coastal city, La Rochelle. In the first step, we set up urban and rural weather stations to characterize the local urban climate over a summer period and to identify local temperature differences. The measurements highlighted a daytime urban cooling effect due to the local sea breeze. While the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) simulation tool used for this study does not capture coastal effects, the results were consistent with the urban heat island (UHI) measurements. We proposed two indicators to quantify the local climate modifications: local UHI and overheating intensity. The parameters of the adaptation strategies were assessed through a sensitivity analysis for these two indicators. For this case-study, we identified vegetation cover, building height and road albedo as key parameters that can be used to mitigate local overheating. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This study is novel in an unprecedented analysis of psychological equivalent temperature (PET), a comprehensive measure of thermal comfort, across socioeconomic groups and the urban-rural gradient of the Netherlands, as a proxy for factors affecting heatwave vulnerability. The results show that heatwave inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) is higher in less urbanized areas. It shows that the population aged 25-44, immigrants, tenants, and females are the most heat-exposed groups across all levels of urbanization. However, the population aged 25-44 is more likely to be overexposed in urbanized areas, and immigrants are more likely to be overexposed in rural areas. The results open discussion on the necessity of location-specific policies protecting the most heatexposed groups in different areas. It also paves the way for future studies using broader PET simulations and expanding their scope to include citizens' daily movements.},

Therefore, it is the need of the day to have a positive water balance for sustainable development of an urban area. The sustainability of water cannot be simply seen as quantitative adequacy but it has other environmental dimensions such as depleting of the groundwater table, drainage problem, and pollution of surface water bodies etc. The present paper focuses on the development of a single index based on a combination of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) and pressure-state-response (PSR) frameworks. In the proposed framework twenty-two sub-indicators have been brought down into seven broad categories to measure the relevant indicators. This single index termed as Water for Development Planning Index (WDPI) may be used for further development planning which will incorporate all aspects of urban water systems. Formulation of WDPI has been established for urban water planning as a decision making tool. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the proposed framework has been developed and applied to Varanasi city where water supply is managed traditionally. The WDPI for Varanasi city is 4.09 (less than 5) which lies in critical condition. Hence, the future planning of the water sector of Varanasi city must reduce the extraction of the water from the natural sources and promote non-conventional practices. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd}

  abstract = {The quality of the housing environment (HE) is an important issue that has a direct impact on the life of inhabitants. Aiming for quality in residential architecture begins with a well-designed HE, with the designing process being a value that is difficult to evaluate. Nowadays, a well-designed HE takes into account the energy efficiency of a building. An appropriate degree of thermal comfort, which is required by inhabitants, needs to be considered at the design stage. Designers can use building certification programs and multi-criteria analysis to motivate investors to construct buildings in accordance with energy efficiency requirements. These systems respond to the needs of energy efficiency, thermal comfort, sustainable heating, and ventilation. Defining ways and methods to evaluate quality in architectural projects will allow the value of the HE to be improved. For this purpose, a multi-criteria analysis of five systems that can be used to evaluate HE quality and energy efficiency in a temperate climate was conducted: (1) Building For Life 12, (2) Home Quality Mark, (3) Housing Quality Indicators, (4) Systeme D'evaluation De Logements (Sel), and (5) NF Habitat-NF Habitat HQE. This analysis concerned information about the systems, their applicability in practice, and the applied assessment measures. The article shows that the quality of the HE consists of specific factors that can be distinguished and indicated by evaluation systems. As a result of the carried out assessment of the housing environment, 13 original categories of building assessment criteria were defined. The results of the conducted analysis indicated that it is possible to: (i) identify factors for the improvement of HE quality; (ii) prepare objective systems for the measurement of the HE; and (iii) use such systems in practice, e.g., in the design industry, real estates, and public administration. Moreover, the systems can be used in legal regulations for updating urban policies.},

  abstract = {Extreme heat is annually the deadliest weather hazard in the United States and is strongly amplified by climate change. In Florida, summer heat waves have increased in frequency and duration, exacerbating negative human health impacts on a state with a substantial older population and industries (e.g., agriculture) that require frequent outdoor work. However, the combined impacts of temperature and humidity (heat stress) have not been previously investigated. For eight Florida cities, this study constructs summer climatologies and trend analyses (1950--2020) of two heat stress metrics: heat index (HI) and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). While both incorporate temperature and humidity, WBGT also includes wind and solar radiation and is a more comprehensive measure of heat stress on the human body. With minor exceptions, results show increases in average summer daily maximum, mean, and minimum HI and WBGT throughout Florida. Daily minimum HI and WBGT exhibit statistically significant increases at all eight stations, emphasizing a hazardous rise in nighttime heat stress. Corresponding to other recent studies, HI and WBGT increases are largest in coastal subtropical locations in central and southern Florida (i.e., Daytona Beach, Tampa, Miami, and Key West) but exhibit no conclusive relationship with urbanization changes. Danger (1038--1248F; 39.48--51.18C) HI and high (.888F; 31.18C) WBGT summer days exhibit significant frequency increases across the state. Especially at coastal locations in the Florida Peninsula and Keys, danger HI and high WBGT days now account for .20},

Understanding how spatial form factors impact local climate parameters and PET values is crucial for optimizing thermal comfort in urban waterfronts. The research addresses the need to improve thermal comfort in rapidly urbanizing areas through strategic urban design. Data were collected from eight measurement points along the riverfront, analyzing Air Temperature (Ta), Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Velocity (v), Surface Temperature (Ts), Global Radiation (G) and Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt). The study employs a combination of field measurements and statistical analysis to assess the correlation between spatial form factors and thermal comfort indicators. Findings reveal that lower building height (Hb) values are associated with more favorable thermal comfort conditions, while higher Hb negatively impacts thermal comfort. The study also highlights that building spacing (ADb) influences thermal comfort, with findings contrasting those from composite climates, suggesting a need for context-specific design strategies. The research underscores the significant role of Ta and v in shaping Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), aligning with previous studies in diverse urban contexts. The results emphasize the critical impact of spatial form on microclimate and thermal comfort, informing urban design and planning to enhance livability along the Ganga riverfront. This study contributes to the field by providing empirical evidence and practical insights for developing thermally comfortable walking trails. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).

Urban heat stress is the most significant indicator of alteration of the urban ecosystem. The variation in built-up areas alters the net radiation budget of urban land surface differently, leading to spatially diverse Intra-Urban Heat Islands within urban areas. However, it is a challenge to identify the specific contribution of built parameters in a heterogeneous built area where the diurnal variation of thermal characteristics is large. Thus, we aim to investigate the diurnal thermal performance of Heterogeneous Built Area (HBA) at canopy-level that cause heat stress. One of the critical indicators of thermal profile, Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt) is analysed, and heat stress is assessed using the thermal index --Physiological Equivalent Temperature. The second component of the study is to identify the significance of build form indices that significantly impacts the Tmrt during peak heating and cooling hours of a day. The study investigates the profile of thermal diversity in a heterogeneous urban area that will subsequently inform guidelines for future policies on build form regulations. {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Social safety is a crucial metric for assessing social stability and progress. Since the housing system reform in 1998, housing prices in Chinese cities have surged for over two decades. Excessively high housing prices have garnered scholarly attention regarding their impact on social safety. However, most existing research explores this impact through a linear perspective. To more comprehensively identify the impact of housing prices on individuals' perceptions of social safety and provide valuable references for formulating scientific and reasonable housing and social policies, this study employs the China Family Panel Studies data and an ordered probit model. Based on the cognition-affective system theory, we empirically examine the impact of housing price increases on individuals' perceptions of social safety and its mechanisms. The findings indicate that rising housing prices initially enhance individuals' perceptions of social safety, but beyond a certain threshold, they diminish this perception, forming an inverted U-shaped relationship. Heterogeneity analysis reveals varying responses among different groups: The older generation and locals exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship in their perceptions of social safety in response to rising housing prices, while the younger generation and nonlocals do not. Additionally, differences in housing ownership, region, gender, and household income contribute to varying perceptions of social safety. Further analysis suggests that improvements in public services and the living environment can enhance individuals' perceptions of social safety. Conversely, high housing prices heighten competition for housing and undermine confidence in future stability, thereby negatively impacting the perception of social safety.},

Solar reflective pavement has been praised as simple, low-cost solution with a demonstrated ability to reduce surface temperature. Less well understood is the effect of solar reflective coatings on radiant heat, which influences human thermal exposure and comfort. We present the first biometeorological observations of solar reflective coating to investigate its thermal performance from a pedestrian perspective. Hourly transects were conducted in two Los Angeles neighborhoods with MaRTy, a mobile platform that measures air, surface, and mean radiant temperature. Transects were performed on July 30, 2019, a typical summer day with low wind speeds and maximum air temperature of 31 degrees C. The surface temperature of coated asphalt concrete was 4 degrees C to 6 degrees C lower than that of regular asphalt concrete, but coated surfaces reflected 118 Wm(-2) more shortwave radiation on average and up to 168 Wm(-2) more at noon. In the evening, MaRTy observed 20 to 30 Wm(-2) of added reflected shortwave radiation on sidewalks next to the reflective pavement. Mean radiant temperature over reflective pavement was 4 degrees C higher during midday. Although air temperature was reduced by 0.5 degrees C in the afternoon, after-sunset cooling was negligible. Findings illustrate the benefits and disadvantages of reflective pavement with respect to various thermal performance metrics. Cities should weigh the tradeoffs of UHI mitigation, thermal exposure, implementation and maintenance costs, lifecycle, and other competing priorities in the context of space use.},

Besides serving as a typical small open economy, Korea provides an interesting laboratory case, since the country was subject to various housing-cycle phases over the sample, and its policymakers implemented active policies to stabilize the housing market. We present a microfounded open-economy model extended to incorporate a housing sector. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods and a large set of observables. We highlight the role of assumptions about house-price expectations on economic dynamics. In the benchmark case of rational expectations, the spillovers from housing to macro variables are modest. House prices are largely driven by sector-specific demand and supply shocks. Business cycle fluctuations are mostly driven by open-economy shocks. When the assumption of rational expectations is relaxed in favor of extrapolative expectations, however, the impact of the housing sector increases. Macroeconomic spillovers from the housing market become more important, with housing shocks accounting for up to twenty percent of fluctuations in the broader economy. {\copyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Most previous studies have investigated whether the house price/income ratio is stationary (short memory) or non-stationary (has a unit root) but have not allowed for the intermediate possibility of long memory or fractional integration. We estimate fractional integration for the house price/income ratio for US states. We find most states exhibit long memory in their ratios. The states with the most long memory tend to be in the high-priced east coast and California. Southern and great plains states, in contrast, tend to exhibit the least persistence in the house price/income metric. In some housing markets--some east coast states, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada, home costs can become less and less affordable for local residents, with no tendency to reverse this unaffordability within a reasonable time horizon for potential buyers. In addition to the univariate estimates, multivariate fractional cointegration tests are implemented, and the results support the findings of non-affordability hypothesis. {\copyright} 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Abstract Although the Scottish electorate voted down independence in 2014, Brexit has led to renewed calls from Scottish political leaders for a second referendum. Scottish independence would likely lead to joining the European Union, and this would obligate Scotland to eventually join the euro common currency. If Scottish home prices were not highly cohesive with those in euro zone countries, the ECB's monetary policy could cause major disruptions for Scottish housing, and, by extension, the Scottish economy. As an example, if most euro-country home values were rising, but those in Scotland were falling, the ECB would likely run a tight monetary policy, which would be devastating to housing conditions in Scotland. We accordingly investigate the co-movement of house prices in Scotland with those in eight major euro zone countries, as well as co-movement between Scottish and UK home prices, using a variety of metrics. The use of methods that are primarily linear indicates that joining the euro may not result in a large loss of co-movement with other regional housing markets, compared to Scotland's current correlation with UK national home prices. However, the use of a measure that takes into account differences in the magnitude, and not just the phase of cycles yields results indicating Scotland exhibits very little co-movement with other euro housing markets. Indeed Scotland has co-movement metrics within the euro countries at levels similar to those of Spain and Ireland, which both suffered devastating booms and busts. Thus leaving sterling for the euro could be highly problematic. JEL classifications: R31, E32, F45 {\copyright} 2021, European Journal of Comparative Economics, All Rights Reserved.},

Substantial differences are observed for minimum (Tmin) and mean temperatures (Tmean) between LCZs. Two-phase nocturnal cooling was recognized with the first cooling phase characterized by intensive LCZ dependent cooling starting at 1--3 h before sunset and lasting until 3--4 h after sunset. The second cooling phase lasts until sunrise and is characterized by less intensive and LCZ nondependent cooling. The most intensive cooling (CRpeak) was observed in first cooling phase of HW and ranged from - 1.6 {$^\circ$}C h-1 in street canyon (LCZ 2) to - 3.9 {$^\circ$}C h-1 in forest (LCZ A). Furthermore, a new cooling indicator (CRtotal) was introduced. Due to cooling differences, the most intensive UHI of 5.5 {$^\circ$}C was noticed between LCZs 2 and A at sunset + 1 h during HW. Two-phase diurnal heating was also recognized in LCZs with the first heating phase characterized by intensive LCZ dependent heating starting at sunrise and lasting until 4--7 h afterwards. The most intensive heating (HRpeak) ranged from 2.0 {$^\circ$}C h-1 in street canyon to 3.0 {$^\circ$}C h-1 in industrial area (LCZ 8) during HW. The second heating phase lasts until sunset and is characterized by less intensive heating and smaller HR differences between LCZs. {\copyright} 2021, ISB.},

  abstract = {This study aims to identify the relationship among microclimate, thermal sensation and human behavior in a residential community in a cold region of China. Five typical residential open spaces in Xi'an, China were investigated using physical measurements, questionnaires and activity records to determine how thermal comfort relates to outdoor activities. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was applied to quantitatively determine the outdoor thermal benchmarks in Xi'an, and variation in thermal benchmarks was compared with other climatic zones. Finally, a `research for design' approach for climate-responsiveness of residential open spaces was proposed based on thermal benchmarks. Results demonstrated that: 1) Except for air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, globe temperature, mean radiative temperature and PET differed significantly among spaces. 2) Residents preferred activities in sunlit spaces in winter, tended to prefer activities in shaded spaces in summer, but activity time and space selections were inconspicuous in spring. 3) Residents can better endure ``cold stress'' in winter than ``hot stress'' in summer when conducting specific activities. 4) The neutral PET, neutral PET range and acceptable PET range were identified as 19.7 {$^\circ$}C, 12.4--26.9 {$^\circ$}C and 9.8--30.7 {$^\circ$}C, respectively; adaptation to the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) relation for Xi'an was also adjusted. 5) Optimum design strategies for open spaces were proposed within implement of shelterbelts, shaded facilities and deciduous trees. These results should help urban designers better understand residents' thermal comfort and adaptive behaviors and provide design guidelines for residential open space in China's cold region. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this research, the parameters related to thermal comfort outdoors like air temperature (Ta), surface temperature (Ts), wind speed (Ws), sky view factor (SVF), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) in an urban street were analyzed using ENVI-met simulation. Besides, the effects of the albedo of pavement and the percent of Fraxinous Exceliour as the dominant tree in the study area were also examined to improve thermal comfort conditions. Simultaneously with the field measurements on the site, a questionnaire was used to determine the thermal comfort range of users in urban canyons. The study also integrates with ENVI-met microclimatic modeling to improve the thermal comfort in the urban street canyon, which was used to simulate the current situation and validated with field measurements, showing a good correlation. The result has revealed that SVF is not a precise indicator for crucial radiation exposure and thermal comfort conditions despite its wide application in previous studies. Further, a notable correlation between SVF and PET is observed solely throughout sunset. Additionally, the combination of the low-albedo pavements and covering half of the street with trees (Fraxinus excelsior) can produce the most effective conditions for thermal comfort. The simulation research reveals that albedo's effect on thermal comfort is less prominent than the tree cover. However, significant changes in albedo values and a decrease in urban heat have no significant impact on improving thermal comfort in urban canyons. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The rise of urbanization has led to many critical issues like increased air pollution, emission of more greenhouse gases, sudden climate change, and a rise in temperature of an urban area compared to surrounding rural regions known as urban heat islands (UHI). It becomes crucial to understand the effect of climatic conditions in those areas. In this present research, we have chosen two different cities: Bhopal and Guwahati, situated over different climatic conditions. The study examines the diurnal, seasonal and inter annual variability of surface UHI (SUHI), using MODIS LST (MOD11A2 and MYD11A2) product of 1 km spatial resolution from 2003 to 2018. The temporal trend of LST is estimated using Mann--Kendall and Sen's slope estimator test. This study also evaluates the land use land cover (LULC) change over the two cities using the LULC data. The present research also incorporates the determination of six different driving factors of SUHI starting from built-up area, urban--rural difference in evapotranspiration, black sky albedo, enhanced vegetation index, thermal inertia, and population. Pearson's correlation criteria are used to determine the correlation of SUHI with each of the determinant parameters. The results reveal the presence of a cool urban island during the summer daytime in Bhopal, while Guwahati shows a positive SUHI. The nighttime shows clear evidence and higher SUHI magnitude than the daytime for Bhopal city. Contrary, a reverse phenomenon is evident in Guwahati with higher SUHI magnitude during the daytime compared to nighttime. The negative SUHI variation can be ascribed to rural area dynamics with the majority of cropland cover. The evapotranspiration shows reasonable control of SUHI's daytime variation. Thermal inertia was found to be an influential parameter in explaining the diurnal variation of SUHI. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper uses statistical analyses to quantify the effects of five major macroeconomic indicators, namely crude oil price, 30-year mortgage interest rate (IR), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and unemployment rate (UR), on housing prices over time. Design/methodology/approach: Housing price is measured as housing price index (HPI) and is treated as a variable affecting itself. Actual housing sale prices in the Town of Amherst, New York State, USA, 1999-2008, and time-series data of the macroeconomic indicators, 2000-2017, were used in a vector autoregression statistical model to examine the data that show the greatest statistical significance and exert maximum quantitative effects of macroeconomic indicators on housing prices. Findings: The analyses concluded that the 30-year IR and HPI have statistically significant effects on housing prices. IR has the highest effect, contributing 5.0 per cent of variance in the first month to 8.5 per cent in the twelfth. The UR has the next greatest influence followed by DJIA and CPI. The disturbance from HPI itself causes the greatest variability in future prices: up to 92.7 per cent in variance 1 month ahead and approximately 74.5 per cent 12 months ahead. This result indicates that current changes in house prices heavily influence people's expectation of future prices. The total effect of the error variance of the macroeconomic indicators ranged from 7.3 per cent in the first month to 25.5 per cent in the twelfth. Originality/value: The conclusions in this paper, along with related tables and figures, will be useful to the housing and real estate communities in planning their business for the next years. {\copyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, limited studies have investigated housing supply restrictions in informal housing markets. To address this knowledge-gap, this article analyzes a range of indicators of livelihood among residents of informal settlements and informal housing supply restrictions in Maputo, Mozambique and Nairobi, Kenya. The findings underscore that informal urban development is restricted to a far higher extent and livelihood in informal settlements is considerably more compromised in Nairobi compared to Maputo, despite that wages are higher in Nairobi and geographic factors likely curtail urban development to a higher extent in Maputo. The empirical evidence and economic theory reviewed in this article consistently indicate that antagonistic approaches to informal urban development in cities with large segments of the population financially excluded from the formal housing markets have comparable consequences to land use restrictions guiding formal urban development. Namely, that informal land users pay a price premium for basic shelter in such contexts due to the increased pressure on the housing markets and risk of loss of investments through forced evictions. On this basis, the article argues that unless viable legal housing alternatives are available, repressive approaches to informal urban development should be abolished while less restrictive standards for building and planning regulation should be adopted to expand provision of affordable legal accommodation and thereby enhance sustainable development.},

The analysis used data from 17 regions of Kazakhstan for 2021, which were collected from the Bureau of National Statistics, Statistical Bulletin of the National Bank, and analytical web portal. Based on the data, three indicators -- down payment affordability (DPA), monthly repayment affordability (MRA), and dynamic indicator TAM, which is the time to achieve adequate MRA -- were calculated. Then the Housing Affordability Quadrant was built. The results of the analysis showed that all regions of Kazakhstan are located in the third quadrant. This means that households in these regions have difficulty making both down and monthly payments. Full housing affordability in any part of the country is not observed. Then the affordability of housing under the preferential mortgage lending program was assessed, and as a result, housing affordability improved only slightly. The authors concluded that the lower the solvency of monthly payments, the less effective the effect of increasing affordability by lowering the interest rate on mortgage loans. Instead, it is recommended to take state control of prices in the real estate market in each region of Kazakhstan. {\copyright} Foundation of International Studies, 2022 and CSR, 2022.},

The aim of this work consists of assessing the impact of urban variables and to quantify the influence of greening on outdoor thermal comfort conditions. The work compares six neighborhoods in the city of Turin characterized by different urban forms, contexts, and green areas. External thermal comfort conditions were measured by evaluating a series of indicators with the support of the ENVI-met tool. Through the analysis of various scenarios, outdoor thermal comfort conditions were measured using green mitigation measures, like vegetated areas, trees, and green roofs. The results allow the evaluation on how outdoor thermal comfort varies in relation to urban form and greenery. By comparing neighborhoods with different urban characteristics, it was possible to define the most effective form for the city of Turin. Higher levels of mean radiant temperature were obtained with open form neighborhoods with a prevalent East-West orientation, a low buildings' density, and a low height-to-width ratio. However, thermal comfort conditions can be mitigated by court-form districts and the presence of greenery, to increase the livability of the urban outdoor environment.},

  abstract = {The regenerative approach to design goes beyond limiting the environmental impact of the built environment and towards the enrichment of the ecosystem, adaptation to climate change, and the improvement of human health. This concept is being applied to buildings through new standards such as the Living Building Challenge, yet examples of implementation of regenerative design at the urban scale are rare. While this is a promising direction for sustainable design, in theory new metrics, design tools and workflows need to be developed to translate regenerative design concepts into practice effectively. Among other factors, barriers to implementation remain rooted in the shortcomings of existing urban simulation tools to evaluate a wide range of performance metrics simultaneously. This paper thus proposes a prototype workflow to evaluate regenerative performance using existing evaluation tools in a single digital workflow. A series of existing and customised plugins, most of which are already in use and open source, were integrated into a multi-parametric workflow based on the Grasshopper visual programming tool. The workflow was tested on Malaga as a case study and incorporated key performance indicators related to outdoor human thermal comfort, biophilia, daylight performance, and energy use and production, based on data exchange and synergies across the different tools. These indicators were evaluated for present and future climate scenarios obtained from a weather generator. This paper demonstrates the potential of this workflow to receive visual feedback on various aspects of regenerative urban design, thus enabling designers to more effectively pursue an evidence-based urban design process.},

This study proposes a framework to evaluate the sustainability of urban water management (UWM), underscoring the significance of expert engagement in identifying appropriate indicators. The study adopts a novel two-step procedure for screening over 300 candidate indicators. A two-stage procedure was followed initially, underpinned by SMART criteria. In the second stage, 24 fit-to-purpose indicators were selected through the fuzzy Delphi method. The framework is subsequently finalized by categorizing the final indicators into seven categories, namely "Water Security," "Water Quality," "Drinking Water," Sanitation and Reuse, "Financial Management," "Governance," and "Risk and Disaster Management," thus facilitating better understanding and linking of UWM practices among diverse stakeholders. The paper demonstrates its application in Mashhad City as a real case. The rapid adoption of the proposed framework in Iran underscores its efficacy in facilitating stakeholders to cultivate collective commitment. This indicator-based framework can assist in identifying essential sustainability trade-offs. In addition, it can also be a practical approach for recognizing water-related priorities to achieve urban water management sustainability. The suggested framework can inspire further expansion of indicator-based frameworks for UWM.}

Consequently, to achieve the objective of social sustainability, the rents of social housing must be below the market rents and low enough to be affordable. Italian law has set several rent thresholds which are based on local territorial agreements between landlords and renters associations. This article aims to examine whether these thresholds generate social fairness and housing affordability within each city and between different cities, or instead inequalities and spatial asymmetries. A cluster analysis is applied to study whether the goal of fairness is achieved, while the effectiveness of providing housing affordability is assessed by comparing the benchmarked rents with those of the national ministerial Real Estate Market Observatory. Two metropolitan cities-one in the north and another in the south of Italy-with different social and economic characteristics were chosen as case studies. The results show that variations in rents, location, and housing quality are fairly consistent within urban areas and cities. However, the benchmarked rents are not consistently related to the market rents and are often higher than the latter, failing to meet the provision of affordable housing that was the primary goal of the law.},

Accordingly, comprehensive analyses are needed to ensure that acceptable criteria of thermal comfort are defined and met in urban environments. The main objective of this study is to define such performance metrics and quality measures of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC), aiming to inform climate-conscious urban design. This article first discusses the motivations for introducing comprehensive thermal comfort metrics, addressing the shortcomings of conventional OTC evaluations that neglect the temporal or spatial variability of OTC. It then introduces four performance metrics, which collectively inform urban planners and designers on the performance of outdoor space with regards to thermal comfort. These metrics build upon the concept of ``autonomy'' previously introduced for indoor spaces and are extended to include the unique characteristics of outdoor thermal comfort. Second, we discuss the capability of these metrics given the limitations of modeling tools available for urban microclimate analysis, and evaluate the critical factors for an accurate evaluation of Outdoor Thermal Comfort Autonomy (OTCA). We observe that the spatial distribution of airflow at the pedestrian height is critical for OTCA calculation, while the consideration of realistic surface heating depends on the urban density. Lastly, we present an example of employing weather clustering methods such that OTC performance metrics are achieved on an annual basis in a comprehensive yet efficient way. By discussing the capability and the limitations of these metrics we aim to promote climate-conscious design using metrics that are tangible and accessible to non-simulationexperts. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Within such response, the communities are faced with limited housing choices that potentially hinder their community resilience and they resist the redevelopment process. This research investigates the indicators of housing choices to measure community resilience capacity in riverside settlements. It uses a mixed-method research design to explore the resilience of the communities in two kampongs along the Citarum River in Bandung Regency, Indonesia, which regularly face flooding during monsoon season. A questionnaire survey of 105 household heads was used as the basis for variance and regression analysis. The paper measures resilience capacity of communities in facing floods using three indicators: survival capacity, perception of the housing redevelopment process, and the capacity to contribute to the housing product. The survival capacity is indicated by the length of stay at the location. Meanwhile, the houses' use value and exchange value determine the community's perception of the housing redevelopment process. Lastly, the contribution of the housing product is implied in the housing design quality in incremental development. The three indicators for assessing the resilience capacity of communities demonstrate the importance of housing choices during the redevelopment process in flood-prone areas. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

However, water supply services in developing countries often exhibit large inefficiencies making it difficult to expand coverage or improve supply services. A comparative assessment of efficiencies in the developed and developing countries is therefore essential to estimate the actual lag that developing countries typically experience, and to arrive at an estimate of their efficiency improvements. This manuscript makes an effort in this direction by undertaking a cross-country benchmarking study on the level of inefficiencies prevailing in Indian urban water supply services (IUWSS) relative to the utilities in the UK-England and Wales. This manuscript uses data envelopment analysis approach to measure relative efficiencies of water supplies for a sample of 30 water utilities in India and the UK-England and Wales for the year 2015. The results indicate that there exist significant technical and scale inefficiencies in water supply operations of Indian municipalities compared with the UK-England and Wales. DEA results also show a significant scope for savings with respect to operating expenditures and non-revenue water, if Indian utilities were to adopt the best practices and managerial tools of the utilities in the UK-England and Wales. Further, it was found that IUWSS need a restructuring of their municipalities to become more efficient. This manuscript discusses the above results in the context of policy implications and suggests few mechanisms that are relevant from a developing country perspective for possible improvement in water supply services.}

These services are mostly perceived as inefficient, reflecting insufficient municipal revenue generations which result in loss-making municipalities that need to be subsidized by the government. The efficiencies and productivities remain largely unmeasured and undetermined, and therefore the perception of inefficient services is not backed by scientific studies. This paper therefore sets up a framework for measuring the performance and productivity of Indian water supply operations. The study utilizes panel data on 21 municipalities observed over the financial years 2005 and 2010, to analyze the relative efficiencies and productivity growths of utilities. Data envelopment analysis is used to obtain efficiency scores and productivity measures such as the Malmquist index. The results indicate the presence of large relative inefficiencies and decreasing productivity of water supply services over time, alluding to a failure to revise tariffs upwards despite increasing input costs over time, thereby driving the need for sector regulation and tariff revision in accordance with X-factors, which was found to have a mean value of 2.4\% for possible price cap regulation in the sector. The paper highlights related policy implications.}

To understand the magnitude and characteristics of UHI in Seoul and to accommodate for the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the UHI which make it inherently challenging to analyze using conventional statistical methods, we developed two deep learning models, a temporal UHI-model and a spatial UHI model, using a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) architecture. Data related to meteorological elements (e.g. air temperature) and urban texture (e.g. surface albedo) were used to train and test the temporal UHI-model and the Spatial UHI-model respectively. Also, we develop and propose a new metric, UHI-hours, that quantifies the total number of hours that UHI exists in a given area. Our results show that UHI-hours is a better indicator of seasonal UHI than the commonly used index, UHI-intensity. Consequently, UHI-hours is likely to provide a better measure of the cumulative effects of UHI over time than UHI-intensity. UHI-hours will help us to better quantify the effect of UHI on, for example, the overall daily productivity of outdoor workers or heat-related mortality rates. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This study aims to explain the dynamic effects of the macroeconomic factors on the three indicators of the housing market performance: housing prices growth, sales index and rent index. Design/methodology/approach This study used ARDL Models on time series data from 1975 to 2020 of the selected macroeconomic factors sourced from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Central Bank of Kenya and Hass Consult Limited. Findings The results indicate that household income, gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rates and exchange rates have both short-run and long-run effects on housing prices while interest rates, diaspora remittance, construction output and urban population have no significant effects on housing prices both in the short and long run. However, only household income, interest rates, private capital inflows and exchange rates have a significant effect on housing sales both in the short and long run. Furthermore, household income, GDP, interest rates and exchange rates significantly affect housing rental growth in the short and long run. The findings are key for policymaking, especially at the appraisal stages of real estate investments by the developers. Practical implications The authors recommend the use of both the traditional hedonic models in conjunction with the dynamic models during real estate project appraisals as this would ensure that developers only invest in the right projects in the right economic situations. Originality/value The imbalance between housing demand and supply has prompted an investigation into the role of macroeconomic variables on the housing market in Kenya. Although the effects of the variables have been documented, there is a need to document the short-run and long-term effects of the factors to precisely understand the behavior of the housing market as a way of shielding developers from economic losses.},

The spatial distribution of urban heat island intensity was obtained using LCZs and MODIS 100 m resolution land surface temperatures from 2013 to 2021. The difference between diurnal and nocturnal heat island intensity (delta UHI) was evaluated as an indicator of the relative heat storage effect between the LCZs. Lower delta UHIs suggest increased relative heat-storage capacities.

Additionally, \& UDelta;UHIs for open and super high-rise, high-rise, and mid-rise LCZs were 5.8 \& DEG;C, 6.4 ?, and 7.8 ?, respectively. Slope data also validated the LCZ height. LCZ and slope analyzes found lower delta UHI magnitudes in all LCZs with high-rise buildings. Also, compact LCZs had lower \& UDelta;UHI magnitudes than open LCZs at corresponding heights.

We present a novel, model-based approach to support the development of effective greening strategies. The approach is quantitative and spatially explicit and accounts for multiple health benefits as well as burdens. In our study, we applied this generic approach to the city of Maastricht (The Netherlands) and conducted an integrated, city-scale assessment of the health benefits and burdens of four urban greenspace designs. These included: 'No greenspace', 'Current greenspace', 'Green parking lots and squares', and 'Optimized greenspace locations'. For each greenspace design, indicator values were calculated for five determinants of health and well-being: heat stress, air pollution, perceived unsafety, unattractive views, and tick-bite risk. To assess the health contribution of urban greenspace in a given design, these indicator values were compared with the values in the 'No greenspace' design. The study produced clear, quantitative conclusions about the health benefits and burdens of the urban greenspace designs for the case of Maastricht but also generated novel, more general insights relevant to the planning of urban greenspace for health and well-being. These insights concern the importance of translating health policy objectives into specific target values or thresholds and the importance of 'smart' choices in greenspace type and location that can effectively reduce trade-offs between health benefits and burdens, as well as the insights that adding more greenery not always improves urban health and that urban greenspace alone cannot solve major air pollution problems. The priorities for future research, which will address the limitations of the presented approach, concern a further expansion of the range of health benefits and burdens covered by the model and the development of a common metric for the entire range of health benefits and burdens to optimize greenspace design and maximize its overall net health benefit.},

Typically, three GI typologies, i.e., green roof, green wall, and street tree, are often recommended and implemented for outdoor thermal comfort modification and passive energy saving. However, the current evaluation of the cooling effects for GI strategies is not comprehensive for two reasons: 1) lacking a holistic assessment to involve different combinations of GI typologies; 2) lacking a spatio-temporal lens to quantify the cooling effects. This study proposes a systematic approach to quantify the cooling effects of GI strategies from a spatio-temporal perspective. Through a parametric study in ENVI-met model, the cooling effect of seven GI strategies were quantified, and different street orientations and sky view factor (SVF) were also involved. Three cooling indicators were proposed for different sustainable planning targets: cooling intensity (CI), cooling area (CA), and cooling duration (CD). The results showed that the seven GI strategies performed differently under various urban morphologies. The greatest cooling effect of GI strategies was observed at SVF = 0.7, after which additional strategies may be needed for urban heat mitigation. Three proposed indicators were found to show similar patterns across the GI strategies, but revealed the details of cooling effects differently. Overall, this study represents the first assessment of the cooling effects of seven GI strategies across different morphological settings. The evidence-based understanding contributed by this study can help planners and designers to optimize the thermal environment in subtropical climate. The systematic approach from a spatio-temporal lens can be transferred to other cities and climate backgrounds. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Rapid and extensive urbanization has adversely impacted humans and ecological entities in the recent decades through a decrease in surface permeability and the emergence of Urban Heat Islands (UHI). While detailed and continuous assessments of surface permeability and UHI are crucial for urban planning and management of landuse zones, they mostly involve time consuming and expensive field studies and single sensor derived large scale aerial and satellite imageries. We demonstrated the advantage of fusing imageries from multiple sensors for landuse and landcover (LULC) change assessments as well as for assessing surface permeability and temperature and UHI emergence in a fast growing city, i.e. Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. IRS-LISSIII and Landsat-7 ETM+ imageries were fused for 2007 and 2017, and classified using a Rotation Forest (RF) algorithm. Surface permeability and temperature were then quantified using Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) index, respectively. Finally, we assessed the relationship between SAVI and LST for entire Tirunelveli as well as for each LULC zone, and also detected UHI emergence hot spots using a SAVI-LST combined metric. Our fused images exhibited higher classification accuracies, i.e. overall kappa coefficient values, than non-fused images. We observed an overall increase in the coverage of urban (dry, real estate plots and built-up) areas, while a decrease for vegetated (cropland and forest) areas in Tirunelveli between 2007 and 2017. The SAVI values indicated an extensive decrease in surface permeability for Tirunelveli overall and also for almost all LULC zones. The LST values showed an overall increase of surface temperature in Tirunelveli with the highest increase for urban built-up areas between 2007 and 2017. LST also exhibited a strong negative association with SAVI. Southeastern built-up areas in Tirunelveli were depicted as a potential UHI hotspot, with a caution for the Western riparian zone for UHI emergence in 2017. Our results provide important metrics for surface permeability, temperature and UHI monitoring, and inform urban and zonal planning authorities about the advantages of satellite image fusion. {\copyright} 2019 Padmanaban et al.

The objective of this study was to assess the water security of large urban areas based on their physical hydrology, existing water supply infrastructure, and water management institutions. This study examined 108 large cities ({$>$} 750,000 people) in the United States (n = 50) and Africa (n = 58), encompassing a broad range of hydrologic and socio-economic conditions, including degrees of institutional complexity. Urban water availability was estimated as the volume of water available from local, natural water sources, as well as water captured via infrastructure such as reservoirs, wellfields, or water transfers. Urban institutional complexity was assessed based on ability to provide, regulate and maintain urban water supplies. Over half of the cities in this study rely on captured water to meet urban demands and maintain high levels of institutional complexity in doing so. Cities able to adequately supply water from local natural sources (37 \%) maintain significantly lower institutional complexity than cities using water captured from non-local sources. Cities categorized as water insecure (7 \%) had minimal access to either local or captured water resources and operated using the simplest water institutions. Results suggest that low local availability drives the urban response for capturing additional water supplies, and is both the cause and product of more complex institutional frameworks. Efforts to address urban water insecurity should focus more attention on meeting not only the physical but managerial needs of a city.}

Urban environments face elevated health risks due to concentrated populations and the urban heat island effect, further amplifying nighttime heat conditions. This study aims to project changes in heat wave characteristics and the associated population exposure risk in a large Mediterranean city, Thessaloniki, Greece. High-resolution climate simulations, using the WRF model, were conducted for three 5-year periods (2006-2010, 2046-2050, 2096-2100) under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, covering Thessaloniki with a 2 km grid. By the end of the century, Thessaloniki is projected to experience over 60 annual heat wave days, compared to similar to 8 in the present climate, while some episodes were found to persist beyond 30 days. The relative risk during heat wave days is expected to rise, which is primarily due to nighttime heat stress. Interestingly, the results indicate that minimum apparent temperature might be a more reliable indicator in predicting heat-related mortality compared to maximum apparent temperature. These findings emphasize the growing importance of informed heat mitigation and adaptation strategies and healthcare preparedness in urban areas facing escalating heat-related health challenges.},

The lack of detailed urban information poses a considerable challenge. This study employs the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) framework to delve into the intricate relationship between land surface temperature (LST) zones and both 2/3D urban characteristics. The LCZ map for Bojnourd city, Iran, was prepared, consisting of eleven classes categorized into five built types and six land cover types. The mean LST in the summer of 2021 was derived from Landsat8 using the split-window algorithm (SWA) and divided into seven thermal zones. The research reveals distinctive spatial patterns of LCZs across various Land LST zones. Notably, LCZ2 (Compact mid-rise) and LCZ 3 (Compact low-rise), despite differing heights, share the same thermal zone (Zone3), suggesting influences beyond height on thermal zoning. In contrast, LCZ5 (Open midrise), situated in a cooler thermal zone (Zone2), features more vegetation and taller trees, exhibiting a lower LST range compared to LCZ2 and LCZ3. Class-level metrics (AREA\_MN and LPI) offer a similar description of LCZ spatial patterns, while landscape-level metrics like SHDI and IJI provide a more insightful depiction of spatial patterns. The study found that the most appropriate spatial pattern for improving urban thermal conditions involves considering a set of factors such as vegetation presence, land cover proximity, height, and density. This ensures sustainable and green urban development that is in tune with climate change and promotes balanced and harmonious thermal patterns in the urban environment. {\copyright} 2024},

Statistical measures and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the variations in LST due to land use type. The correlations between LST and the indices (NDVI and NDBI) and population density were also computed. The results show variations in LST due to land use type (at 0.01 level of significance) and the differences in the thermal regimes of the two cities.

  abstract = {For sustainable development of urban areas, it is essential to address urban water management integrated with the urban water systems and spatial planning of the cities and the subsequent uncertainties. An integrated urban water management and planning model will help ensure water security, mitigate floods and droughts, reduce the negative environmental impact of urbanization and climate change, and bring coherence in the water supply management with the cities' spatial planning and relevant policies. In the present research, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision analysis, has been implemented to calculate the weightage of different parameters associated with urban water management and planning. AHP uses linguistic and quantitative variables based on experts' opinions for selecting and prioritizing the objectives and parameters for an integrated approach to urban water management and spatial planning under uncertainties. The local and global weights of objectives, parameters, key indicators, and sub-indicators were calculated after pairwise comparison by 32 experts from academia and industry in urban planning and civil and environmental engineering for the case of Ranchi, a city in eastern India. The study establishes the financial factors (36.97\%) as one of the important attributes, followed by environmental factors (26.71\%) for consideration in integrated urban water management. Further, Alternative D (45.256\%) is framed by collaborating different objectives of IUWM, such as ensuring water security through alternative water sources, mitigating floods and droughts, and water supply planning considering land use, management policies, and climate change. The research findings can assist decision-makers in prioritizing the various objectives and parameters for integrated urban water management in cities with similar population sizes and organic growth.},

Even though optimization of water distribution systems and integrated water management practices are being implemented in many cities and regions, there is a lack of an integrated study considering the urban water supply system, planning, and management. This paper identifies the various parameters and indicators to be considered along with the relevant tools and techniques for optimizing water resources, optimum water resource allocation, and integrated water supply and management. During the research, 116 indicators were identified through a literature review, followed by a three-round Delphi survey to attain consensus from 30 experts. At the end of the third round, 72 indicators achieved maximum consensus among the experts (W=0.741). The identified indicators can be used for developing an integrated model for urban water supply systems, planning, and management. {\copyright} 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.}

Special emphasis is placed on the bioclimatic index UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index), whose purpose is to evaluate the degree of thermal stress that the human body is exposed to. For this research, mean daily and hourly (07:00 and 14:00 CET) meteorological data from three weather stations (Zlatibor, Novi Sad and Ni{\v s}) have been collected for the period from 1998 to 2017. In order to identify patterns of biothermal heat stress conditions, the thresholds of the daily UTCI (UTCI 38C, referred to as very strong heat stress, VSHS) at 14:00 CET are compared with the thresholds of daily maximum air temperature (tmax 35C, referred to as hot days, HDs), which are further termed as heat wave events (HWEs). The findings show that the UTCI heat stress category "very strong heat stress" at 14:00 CET indicates heat waves. The most extreme heat wave events occurred in 2007, 2012, 2015 and 2017. Moreover, three HWEs at Ni{\v s} that occurred in July 2007 lasted 3, 10 and 4 d. HWEs and very strong heat stress events (VSHSEs) recorded in July 2007 (lasted 10 d each), 2012 (lasted 9 and 12 d) and 2015 (lasted 7 and 10 d) were of the longest duration and are considered to be the indicators of biothermal heat hazard. The daily UTCI14 h heat stress becomes more extreme in terms of severity and heat wave duration up to very strong heat stress. {\copyright} 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

However, the scale-dependence of LST influencing factors has not been fully explored, due to relatively discrete scales or single factor used in previous studies. It is a great challenge to explore the approach to prioritizing research scales in view of the influencing factors of LST. Taking the urban group of Xi'an City and Xianyang City in Western China as a case study area, this study proposed a wavelet coherence approach to identifying the prioritizing LST influencing factors and research scales. Based on the sample transects, the results showed that around 1 km could be used as the prioritizing research scale for simultaneously exploring multiple LST influencing factors. And the normalized difference build-up index was the dominant influencing factor with the strongest multi-scale stability. The coherence relationships with LST of the area percentage of blue land, and the mean patch area of blue land represented high spatial heterogeneity, with multi-scale stability in the area of widespread water body. The normalized difference vegetation index should also be highlighted due to the multi-scale stability and stable medium coherence with LST. This study proposed a wavelet coherence approach to exploring spatial heterogeneity and scale-dependence of the relationship between LST and multiple influencing factors.},

In this study, an attempt to develop a technology of real-time prediction of thermal comfort conditions in urban landscape is described (based on the example of Moscow State University campus). For this, the authors used a RayMan model-based algorithm for calculating three most popular worldwide comfort indexes. In the scripting method, predictive data of the Canadian global model meteorological parameters are automatically transferred to the RayMan-model (with an implementation of the unique thermal and radiation properties of the Moscow State University campus landscape) by using an autoclicker software. For the convenience of perception of the information, the results of calculations are visualized on the basis of a free web mapping service. Thus, the main idea of the work is that any user with minimum expenditure of his time resource and without knowledge of the model's work can launch the program and receive an individual forecast of comfort conditions for the next few hours in a visually understandable format. It is suggested that the developed methodology will be used for calculations on projected areas to identify the safest construction option. Such realtime forecasting will continue to be of particular importance for urban infrastructure. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {A variant of the methodology for quantitatively assessing the availability, comfort and environmental safety of residential areas was proposed by the authors. The principles of creating a biosphere-compatible city, without conflict with the environment and developing a person, were taken as a basis. According to the main provisions of this concept, the degree of implementation of the city's functions is determined by the level of accessibility of these functions for all of its residents, regardless of the characteristics of their health and age. It is proposed to introduce the parameter of time to meet human needs into the system of indicators of master plans as one of the parameters of a comfortable and safe urban environment. It is supposed that socially significant objects of everyday service of residents, as well as open spaces for recreation, should be located on the territory of residential buildings within walking distance at a comfortable distance from the places of residence. At the same time, pedestrian communications in residential areas, in particular those leading from places of residence to the objects under consideration, must comply with environmental safety requirements, as well as open urban spaces for recreation, games, and sport. To assess these parameters an integral indicator, one of the components of which is the predicted level of thermal comfort, was proposed in the work. To determine it, it is proposed to use the bioclimatic index, that is the physiological equivalent temperature (PET). In this work, based on the example of a new residential area in the city of Orel, the corresponding integral indicators were determined in terms of assessing the availability of educational facilities and open green urban spaces, including some points of pedestrian communications. The calculation results showed that when planning a new micro-district, the values of the levels of implementation of city functions in terms of the accessibility of socially significant objects, as well as the levels of comfort and environmental safety of pedestrian communications and open urban spaces, differ significantly from the maximum possible. It is noted that when designing a micro-district and arranging pedestrian communications and open spaces, no attention was paid to ensuring a comfortable climatic regime. Conclusions about the influence of built environment on the temperature regime in the territories of the considered locations are made. It is supposed that expanding the range of indicators for assessing territorial planning projects for analyzing accessibility by time parameter, as well as for assessing the level of environmental safety and comfort, will increase the efficiency of the use of urban planning methods in the planning and development of residential micro-districts in order to create an urban environment that contributes to the preservation of health of residents. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is an important research topic in the scholarly community. There are only few research studies related to the UHI in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA). Therefore, this study examined the impact of urbanization on the formation of UHI in the SMA as a geospatial study by using Landsat data from 1996, 2006, and 2017. For this purpose, we analyzed the relative variation of land surface temperature (LST) with changes of land use/land cover (LULC) rather than absolute values of LST using gradient, intensity, and directional analyses. It was observed that the impervious surface (IS) has expanded, and the UHI effect was more penetrating in the study area, with considerable loss of other LULC including green surfaces along with the rapid urbanization of the study area. In this study, we divided the IS into persistent IS (PIS) and newly added IS (NAIS). The spatial distribution of the IS, forest surface (FS), PIS, and NAIS was observed based on gradient zones (GZs). The results show that GZ1 recorded a difference of 6.0 {$^\circ$}C when compared with the GZ109 in 2017. The results also show that the city center was warmer than the surrounding areas during the period of study. Results reveal that the mean LST has a strong significant positive relationship with a fraction of IS and PIS in 2006 and 2017. On other hand, the mean LST has a strong negative relationship with a fraction of FS and NAIS in the same time points. Relatively low temperatures were recorded in FS and NAIS in both time points. Further, it was proved that the local climate of the SMA and its surroundings had been affected by the UHI effect. Therefore, urban planners of the SMA should seriously consider the issue and plan to mitigate the effect by improving the green surfaces of the city. More greening-oriented concepts are recommended in both horizontal and vertical directions of the SMA, that can be used to control the negative impact associated with UHI. The overall outputs of the study could be used as a proxy indicator for the sustainability of the SMA and its surroundings. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

The military conflict, now in its second year, is changing the priorities of the public housing policy and requiring the search for new efficient methods of restoring the lost housing stock and regulating housing construction. The article addresses the volume of capital investment in residential construction in Ukraine and explains the financial framework for residential construction regulation. World best practices in the use of financial instruments in the regulation of the industry are systematized. The authors' view of the system of financial leverage of residential construction regulation is offered. The analysis of the housing affordability indicators shows that the average household income is insufficient to purchase housing and repay a mortgage. Meanwhile, the research indi-cates that a mortgage is one of the most common financial instruments for the purchase of housing for Ukrainians. The analysis of the level and dynamics of mortgage interest rates shows that they are 4.6 times higher in the euro than in the EU countries. The study of modern housing practices in Ukraine emphasizes the need to introduce new principles of sustainable financial regulation in residential construction. The article sub-stantiates a set of these principles and recommends their implementation.

The adaptation to climate change requires the development of new design guidelines for the development of public spaces. The appropriate definition of development density, choice of building materials, technologies, planting species, and the used directions is a challenge that depends on local conditions. A representative public space located in the area of a multi-family housing estate built in the second half of the 20th century in Lublin (Poland) was selected for the study. The space has undergone redevelopment twice in the last 10 years. The aim of the study was to determine to what extent the executed and designed changes actually improve the thermal comfort of users. Quantitative and qualitative indicators of the successive phases of the investment were analyzed in the context of projected climate change. The simulation was developed using the ENVI-met version 5.0 software. As a result of the changes made, there has been an improvement in usability and comfort. Five simulations were carried out for the warmest day of the year for one of the public spaces in the city of Lublin. The sensation of PET thermal comfort was investigated for people aged 35 and 75, as a particularly sensitive group. The obtained result proved that the elderly feel higher temperature rates than younger people. In one of the simulations, new plantings were proposed to improve the local microclimate. The material temperatures of paved surfaces were also investigated. The article shows how the local microclimate and people's desire to stay in a given space can be improved with new tree planting.},

Among others, the intensification of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is leading to an increased impact on citizen health and the urban ecosystem. In this context, this study aims to investigate the effect of urban morphology and land cover composition---which are established by exploiting the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification system---on two urban climate indicators, i.e., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature. The study area is the Metropolitan City of Milan (northern Italy). LCZ and LST maps are derived by leveraging satellite imagery and building height datasets. Both authoritative and crowdsourced in situ measurements are used for the analysis of air temperature. Several experiments are run to investigate the mutual relation between LCZ, LST, and air temperature by measuring LST and air temperature patterns in different LCZs and periods. Besides a strong temporal correlation between LST and air temperature, results point out vegetation and natural areas as major mitigating factors of both variables. On the other hand, higher buildings turn out to increase local air temperature while buffering LST values. A way lower influence of building density is measured, with compact building areas experiencing slightly higher air temperature yet no significant differences in terms of LST. These outcomes provide valuable tools to urban planners and stakeholders for implementing evidence-based UHI mitigation strategies. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 is intrinsically linked to the environment, one facet of which is the need for universal access to secure, inclusive, and accessible green and public places. As urban heat islands (UHI) have the potential to negatively influence cities and their residents, existing resources and data must be used to identify and quantify these effects. To address this, we present the use of satellite-derived (2013--2022) and meteorological data (2014--2020) to assess intra-urban heat islands in Manila City, Philippines. The assessment includes (a) understanding the temporal variability of air temperature measurements and outdoor thermal comfort based on meteorological data, (b) comparative and correlative analysis between common Land-Use Land Cover indicators (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), (c) spatial and temporal analysis of LST using spatial statistics techniques, and (d) generation of an intra-urban heat island (IUHI) map with a recommended class of action using a suitability analysis model. Finally, the areas that need intervention are compared to the affected population, and suggestions to enhance the thermal characteristics of the city and mitigate the effects of UHI are established. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

Optimal orientation would improve the quality of the building's thermal comfort as well as its urban area, considering the geography and climate of the area. Conversely, orientation and physical form of the buildings (particularly high-rise buildings) which are incompatible with climate could create a phenomenon called ``urban heat island'' and disrupt their thermal comfort. Moreover, vegetation as one of the outdoor affecting factors, through creating air movement and shading can help in enhancing the thermal comfort sensation. This paper, through a descriptive-ana-lytical method, firstly explored the theoretical foundations around thermal comfort and the effects of morphology and vegetation on that. Secondly, a high-rise building complex located in Maslak district of Istanbul, a modern and developing region with the Mediterranean climate, was chosen as a case study. Three design alternatives, including the current design and two hypothetical design alternatives for building orientation and vegetation parameters, have been analyzed and the thermal comfort indicators, PMV and PPD have been calculated by Envi-met software. By evaluating and comparing the outputs, it can be concluded that con-trolling these two parameters (building orientation and vegetation) could have a positive impact on outdoor thermal comfort. {\copyright} 2021, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

  abstract = {In the present age, environmental sustainability has been severely challenged because of the human constructions and changes in the ecological landscape of cities so that the issue of the compatibility of urban development with these changes has become especially important. Changes in morphology, structure, form and geometry of the cities, which are themselves caused by changes in the form of urban complexes and geometry of buildings, have a profound effect on the micro-climate and sustainability of urban environments by the efficient adjustments. To assess environmental sustainability or unsustainability in urban neighborhoods, thermal comfort is considered as a good indicator. The assessment of this qualitative concept requires the use of quantitative indicators and assessment tools that can be spatially presented to urban planners and designers to help them in urban development plans. The PMV/PPD model uses heat-balance equations and empirical studies to calculate the `predicted mean vote' and `predicted percentage of dissatisfied', which are somehow derived from the parameters that affect thermal comfort. The innovation of the present study compared to the background of the researches is the evaluation of urban building design policies in thermal comfort, which fills the gap between the evaluations of the level and scale of architecture and urban planning in previous researches. An applied and descriptive-analytical research method has been used in the present study. Firstly, data needed to evaluate the main purpose of the research in the selected site located in the Gheytariyeh neighborhood of Tehran were collected. They are then simulated and analyzed. The results indicate that the difference in the geometry of the buildings and the city blocks can make a difference in the heating comfort of the different city neighborhoods and residents. The recent study has proven that the difference in the city blocks (3- and 4-dimensional and square shapes) can affect the comfort and temperature factors. Spatial simulations conducted in the present study by ENVI-met software show that compared to other indices studied, the PMV and PPD indices have the least distance from the ideal thermal comfort conditions in the design of trilateral high-rise buildings and have the greatest distance from them in the design of rectangular building blocks. It is worth noting that the adoption of policies and regulations related to the design and architecture of urban neighborhoods by the implementation of urban development policies is one of the measures required when the urban development plans are drafted and approved. The simulations model indicates that the minimum and maximum values of PPD index have been respectively equal to 51.06},

We calculated two metrics to assess the magnitude and frequency of heat stress conditions, wet bulb temperature and wet bulb globe temperature, and compared our in situ data to that collected by weather stations. We found that informal settlement residents experience chronic heat stress conditions, which are underestimated by weather stations. Wet bulb temperatures approached the uppermost limits of human survivability, and wet bulb globe temperatures regularly exceeded recommended physical activity thresholds, both in houses and outdoors. Under a warming climate, a growing number of people living informally will face potentially severe impacts from heat stress that have likely been previously overlooked or underestimated. {\copyright} 2021 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure the long-run housing affordability of Malaysia over time for households at various income levels and to demonstrate how short- and long-run affordability measures can reach contradicting conclusions. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a long-run housing affordability index (HAI) for Malaysia was constructed for the sample period 1995 to 2014, using data from house prices and household incomes. The HAI was also modified to compute a mortgage affordability index (MAI) to account for intergenerational transfers. Findings: The results show that households at the 25th income percentile cannot afford any of the four dwelling types in Malaysia. For households at the 40th income percentile and the median income levels, high-rise and terrace housing are affordable. However, significant downward trends in HAI and MAI are documented beginning 2009, which indicates increasing housing stress for households at or below the median income. The short-run affordability measure represented by the median multiple (MM) indicator showed bleaker conclusion for housing affordability, with all dwelling types considered unaffordable over the entire sample period Practical implications: On the basis of the empirical results, this paper provided several long-term proposals to ameliorate the housing affordability problem in Malaysia. Originality/value: With the MM ratio being the official affordability measure reported for Malaysia, this study introduces the nation's first long-run housing affordability measure. It is hoped that this long-run measure will achieve widespread adoption in Malaysia. Given the deteriorating long-term affordability, this study offers several possible long-term solutions. {\copyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper compares the annual rate of changes in employment and the size of taxation to identify the relationship between the rate of growth or decline. The analysis made it possible to determine the main indicators that affect the rate of changes in the construction sector. Construction costs are calculated to determine the amount of project costs and client's expenses (architect's fee, website, VAT, production prices, household expenses, etc.). The key indicators affecting the construction sector are compared. These are the number of enterprises, the number of employees, turnover, value added, personnel costs, investment in material goods. A summary table of corporate taxation in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries is presented. The table reflects types of taxes and key interest rates. The dynamics of sales of new housing is analyzed for each country.

Here we present evidence from multiple reanalysis and in situ datasets that evening or nighttime daily maxima in extreme wet-bulb temperature and heat index are widespread along the southern Persian/Arabian Gulf coastline and adjacent inland desert, driven principally by sea-breeze-related movements of moist maritime air. This timing runs counter to the general expectation of more intense heat and greater heat-stress risk during daytime hours. While wet-bulb temperature is one of many metrics relevant for understanding heat hazards, it has featured prominently in recent literature and its values are closer to uncompensable-heat limits in coastal Arabia than anywhere else. Deviations from an afternoon-peak assumption about heat risks are thus of critical importance and heighten the value of improved understanding of extreme-humid-heat meteorology, in this region and in others subject to similar physical processes. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

Change in UHII, however, can be affected by change in urban or rural temperature, or both. Numerous studies have investigated the change of UHII, but how it relates to change in urban and rural temperature is poorly understood. Here we present a continental scale analysis on the change in UHII from 2000 to 2015 in 31 major cities in China, and further explored whether such change was caused by urban warming. We used time series analysis based on MODIS land surface temperature product (MOD11A2) in summer.

  abstract = {Improving resource management in urban areas has been enshrined in visions for achieving sustainable urban areas, but to date it has been difficult to quantify performance indicators to help identify more sustainable outcomes, especially for water resources. In this work, we advance quantitative indicators for what we refer to as the `metabolic' features of urban water management: those related to resource efficiency (for water and also water-related energy and nutrients), supply internalisation, urban hydrological performance, sustainable extraction, and recognition of the diverse functions of water. We derived indicators in consultation with stakeholders to bridge this gap between visions and performance indicators. This was done by first reviewing and categorising water-related resource management objectives for city-regions, and then deriving indicators that can gauge performance against them. The ability for these indicators to be quantified using data from an urban water mass balance was also examined. Indicators of water efficiency, supply internalisation, and hydrological performance (relative to a reference case) can be generated using existing urban water mass balance methods. In the future, indicators for water-related energy and nutrient efficiencies could be generated by overlaying the urban water balance with energy and nutrient data. Indicators of sustainable extraction and recognising diverse functions of water will require methods for defining sustainable extraction rates and a water functionality index. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd}

Slum severity indices drawing on indicators defined by UN-Habitat have served to map precarious communities in large Global South cities. However, these assessments cannot capture the heterogeneity of self-built homes within consolidated informal settlements. Building on a case study of a consolidated informal settlement in Mexico City, this research presents a replicable model to measure the range of variability of housing quality by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. We used architectural observations and household surveys to construct a qualitative database of housing quality indicators identified by self-help builders. This fine-grained database allowed us to develop a housing quality index that revealed the heterogeneity of housing quality. We then conducted in-depth interviews that illuminated factors beyond household income that shape the consolidation of self-help buildings, including participation in community-based self-help efforts, apprenticeships, incorporation in social networks, and government assistance. By providing fine-grained documentation of self-help housing heterogeneity based on local knowledge, we contribute a globally applicable model to inform more empirically informed and locally appropriate approaches to participatory slum upgrading in informal settlements. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study explores the potential effects of landscape interventions on outdoor thermal comfort, testing two thermal comfort indicators on a selected hospitality development. Results are crucial factors to consider as the success of hospitality developments and its outdoor spaces are dependent on how visitors perceive and interact with them. Digital simulations were conducted using Rhinoceros software and the Grasshopper tool to produce heat maps. For the purpose of the study, two sets of simulations were developed to examine changes in the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and Incident Radiation of the site - a) buildings alone and b) with landscape elements. As a result, UTCI with landscape intervention decreased by 2{$^\circ$}C while Incident Radiation is significantly lower throughout spaces provided with shading elements. Results of UTCI simulations still deliver strong heat stress to occupants, while Incident Radiation has considerably improved with landscape interventions. The provision of shading elements helped lessen solar radiation penetrating the site, thus improving the thermal comfort of users. Wind velocity showed minimal effects on perceived heat based on the UTCI assessment scale. Nonetheless, improvement in the planning and orientation of buildings and strategic provision of demountable sun shading elements in future developments are recommended to allow better air circulation. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An accurate assessment of the future water supply/demand balance is crucial to capital investment for water infrastructure. This paper aims to present five intervention strategies, which are suggested to solve the future water crisis. The strategies combined include environmentally sustainable options such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling and water demand management, as well as desalination. These strategies were evaluated under four population growth scenarios (very fast, fast, moderate and slow growths) by using several Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) including water demand, leakage levels, total costs, energy consumption, rainwater delivered and greywater recycled. Moreover, it also aims to develop a methodology for similar islands, using the WaterMet2modelling approach, a tool for integrated of sustainable-based performance of urban water systems. The results obtained show that by 2044 only a small portion of the future water demand can be covered assuming business as usual. Therefore, desalination seems to be the most viable option in order to mitigate the lack of water at the end of the planning period considering the growth trends. However, strategies comprising more environmentally friendly alternatives may be sufficient, but only under slow population growth scenarios. {\copyright} 2017 by the authors.},

Using a county-level database of the U.S. hydro-economy, NWED, we spatially mapped and analyzed the Water Footprint of Flagstaff, Arizona, a small city. Virtual water inflow and outflow networks were developed using the flow of commodities into and out of the city. The power law distribution of virtual water trade volume between Flagstaff and its county trading partners broke at a spatial distance of roughly 2000 km. Most large trading partners are within this geographical distance, and this distance is an objective definition for Flagstaff's zone of indirect hydro-economic influence - that is, its water resource hinterland. Metrics were developed to measure Flagstaff's reliance on virtual water resources, versus direct use of local physical water resources. Flagstaff's reliance on external water supplies via virtual water trade increases both its hydro-economic resilience and vulnerability to water scarcity. These methods empower city managers to operationalize the city's Water Footprint information to reduce vulnerability, increase resilience, and optimally balance the allocation of local physical water supplies with the outsourcing of some water uses via the virtual water supply chain. {\copyright} 2016.

The Heat Stress Exposure (HSE) metric includes both duration and intensity dimensions of heat exposure, and in this paper it is applied to the Sydney Australia climatology. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to spatially represent and visualize Sydney's HSE. The first stage of the analysis collated observed meteorological data from 10 weather stations across the Sydney metropolitan region, extending from coastal Sydney to approximately 50 km inland in 2017. The second stage of the analysis integrated the radiative meteorological data into estimates of hourly Mean Radiant Temperature which were then applied to UTCI. In the final stage, a threshold UTCI value of 26 {$^\circ$}C was selected for the calculation of HSE, which was then cumulated to represent the duration of heat exposure throughout the year. The difference between each UTCI hourly reading and the 26 {$^\circ$}C threshold defined a UTCI exceedance ({$\Delta$}UTCI; {$^\circ$}C). The cumulative total of all {$\Delta$}UTCI throughout the year defined {$\sum\Delta$}UTCI in units of degree hours ({$^\circ$}C.hr), thereby capturing both intensity and duration of exposure to heat stress. Weather systems driving westerly winds from the Australian continent's central deserts brought the highest HSE to Sydney's inland western suburbs, with values ranging between 4,000--6,000 {$\sum\Delta$}UTCI ({$^\circ$}C.hr). Coastal eastern Sydney experienced considerably lower HSE values ranging from 1,600--3,000 {$\sum\Delta$}UTCI ({$^\circ$}C.hr), reflecting the moderating influences of sea breezes and evaporative cooling. {\copyright} 2021},

Numerous people are affected by climate change in their daily life, health and well-being. The need to react is undisputed and has led to numerous guidelines and directives for urban climate adaptation. Plants are commonly mentioned and recommended as one key to urban climate adaptation. Due to shading of open space and building surfaces, as well as evapotranspiration, plants reduce the energy load on the urban fabric and increase thermal comfort and climate resilience amongst many other ecosystem services. Plants, therefore, are described as green infrastructure (GI), because of the beneficial effects they provide. Extensive green roofs are often discussed regarding their impact on thermal comfort for pedestrians and physical properties of buildings. By means of Stadslab2050 project Elief Playhouse in Antwerp, Belgium, a single-story building in the courtyard of a perimeter block, the effects of different extensive green roof designs (A and B) on the microclimate, human comfort at ground and roof level, as well as building physics are analyzed and compared to the actual roofing (bitumen membrane) as the Status Quo variant. For the analyses and evaluation of the different designs the innovative Green Performance Assessment System (GREENPASS{\textregistered}) method has been chosen. The planning tool combines spatial and volumetric analyses with complex 3D microclimate simulations to calculate key performance indicators such as thermal comfort score, thermal storage score, thermal load score, run-off and carbon sequestration. Complementary maps and graphs are compiled. Overall, the chosen method allows to understand, compare and optimize project designs and performance. The results for the Elief Playhouse show that the implementation of green roofs serves a slight contribution to the urban energy balance but a huge impact on the building and humans. Variant B with entire greening performs better in all considered indicators, than the less greened design Variant A and the actual Status Quo. Variant B will probably bring a greater cost/benefit than Variant A and is thus recommended. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

Therefore, tools need to be applied to identify the most suitable and efficient location and type of NBS.

The Greenpass system comprises of standardized tools, reports and a unique set of Key Performance Score (KPS) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This paper deals with the impact assessment of NBS by the use of the innovative Greenpass system for the CLEVER-cities project 'Fischbeker Hofe' in Hamburg, Germany to ensure human health and well-being improvements for the citizens. To that end and considering the climate change context, thermal comfort is a KPI with high relevance in terms of the NBS co-benefits. Based on the PET within a project area Greenpass calculates the Thermal Comfort Score (TCS). The share of the different PET classes within the project area is multiplied with a weighting factor and summarized to the TCS. The results of the climate resilience analysis of the urban development area 'Fischbeker Hofe' in Hamburg are presented and discussed in comparison to a conventional architecture that disregards NBS, showing improvement with regards to four out of five KPS. Based on the evaluation results, advice is given to the co-creative design team on how to further improve the design towards climate resilience. The Greenpass system has proven to be a powerful and tailored tool to support climate resilient urban design and architecture.

The CBF provides a clear overview of sustainable urban water management performance and its bottlenecks in municipalities and regions. The GCF comprises nine governance conditions which each consist of three indicators. The GCF provides insight in the most effective improvements to increase the governance capacity to address the identified urban water challenges. Our results show that poor wastewater treatment and long-term drinking water security are Quito's main water challenges that may be jeopardized given the city's rapid urbanization and economic pressure. The GCF analysis reveals that cooperation between stakeholders, implementing capacity and citizens' awareness are the most important conditions for further development to find adequate solutions for Quito's long-term drinking water security. We also suggest that more attention should be drawn to the transparency, accountability and participation principles. The results of Quito show that the City Blueprint Approach can serve as an affordable quick-scan to facilitate cities in their strategic planning to reach their sustainable development goals.},

  abstract = {Global warming is leading to increased heat stress in many regions around the world. An extensive number of heat stress indicators (HSIs) has been developed to measure the associated impacts on human health. Here we calculate eight HSIs for global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We compare their future trends as function of global mean temperature, with particular focus on highly populated regions. All analyzed HSIs increase significantly (p {\textexclamdown} 0.01) in all considered regions. Moreover, the different HSIs reveal a substantial spread ranging from trends close to the rate of global mean temperature up to an amplification of more than a factor of two. Trends change considerably when normalizing the HSIs by accounting for the different scales on which they are defined, but the large spread and strong trends remain. Consistently, exceedances of impact-relevant thresholds are strongly increasing globally, including in several densely populated regions, but also show substantial spread across the selected HSIs. The indicators with the highest exceedance rates vary for different threshold levels, suggesting that the large indicator spread is associated both to differences in trend magnitude and the definition of threshold levels. These results highlight the importance of choosing indicators and thresholds that are appropriate for the respective impact under consideration. Additionally, further validation of HSIs regarding their capability to quantify heat impacts on human health on regional-to-global scales would be of great value for assessing global impacts of future heat stress more reliably. {\copyright} 2021.

  abstract = {Heat stress in cities is projected to strongly increase due to climate change. The associated health risks will be exacerbated by the high population density in cities and the urban heat island effect. However, impacts are still uncertain, which is among other factors due to the existence of multiple metrics for quantifying ambient heat and the typically rather coarse spatial resolution of climate models. Here we investigate projections of ambient heat for 36 major European cities based on a recently produced ensemble of regional climate model simulations for Europe (EURO-CORDEX) at 0.11{$^\circ$} spatial resolution ({\^g}1/412.5km). The 0.11{$^\circ$} EURO-CORDEX ensemble provides the best spatial resolution currently available from an ensemble of climate model projections for the whole of Europe and makes it possible to analyse the risk of temperature extremes and heat waves at the city level. We focus on three temperature-based heat metrics - yearly maximum temperature, number of days with temperatures exceeding 30{$^\circ$}C, and Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId) - to analyse projections of ambient heat at 3{$^\circ$}C warming in Europe compared to 1981-2010 based on climate data from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble. The results show that southern European cities will be particularly affected by high levels of ambient heat, but depending on the considered metric, cities in central, eastern, and northern Europe may also experience substantial increases in ambient heat. In several cities, projections of ambient heat vary considerably across the three heat metrics, indicating that estimates based on a single metric might underestimate the potential for adverse health effects due to heat stress. Nighttime ambient heat, quantified based on daily minimum temperatures, shows similar spatial patterns to daytime conditions, albeit with substantially higher HWMId values. The identified spatial patterns of ambient heat are generally consistent with results from global Earth system models, though with substantial differences for individual cities. Our results emphasise the value of high-resolution climate model simulations for analysing climate extremes at the city level. At the same time, they highlight that improving the predominantly rather simple representations of urban areas in climate models would make their simulations even more valuable for planning adaptation measures in cities. Further, our results stress that using complementary metrics for projections of ambient heat gives important insights into the risk of future heat stress that might otherwise be missed. {\copyright} Copyright:},

The life cycle optimisation framework allows for optimal desalination planning by considering choices over intake type, staging and location of the infrastructure under different land-use, environmental and economic policies. Optimality is defined by the decision maker's selected objective function, being either an environmental impact or a levelised cost indicator. The framework was tested for future desalination planning scenarios in the northern metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia. Results indicate that multi-staged construction and decentralised planning solutions may produce lower life cycle environmental impacts (58\%) and at a lower levelised cost (24\%) than a centralised desalination solution currently being considered by Western Australian water planners. Sensitivity analysis results suggest that the better environmental and economic performance of decentralised planning over centralised planning is highly sensitive to the proportion of land that can be made available for the siting of decentralised plants near the demand zone. Insight into land use policies is a critical factor to the initiation and success of decentralised solution in developed metropolitan areas. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.}

Utilizing quantitative analysis, a residential neighbourhood model situated near Cairo International Airport, between Nasr City and Fifth Settlement, was developed to gauge sustainable and liveable indicators. The evaluation encompasses various sustainable indicators including housing typology, density, mixed-use zoning, education access, transportation infrastructure, parking management, green space provision, and sustainable materials adoption. Liveability was evaluated by analysing thermal comfort metrics such as wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity using ENVI-met software. Results indicate successful achievement of sustainability indicators, illustrating the efficacy of implemented strategies in fostering sustainable residential environments. However, inadequacies in meeting liveability standards underscore the need for additional sustainable solutions to address escalating air temperatures and enhance resident satisfaction. Proposed solutions include enhancing accessibility, promoting sustainable transportation, diversifying land uses, implementing eco-friendly materials, and augmenting green spaces. Prioritizing shaded areas and increasing tree coverage are recommended to alleviate temperature levels and ensure thermal comfort and community engagement. {\copyright} 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Here we introduce detailed stereoscopic urban morphology indices, including the Height Variation Coefficient, the Height Gravity Index, the Mixed Degree, and the Aggregation Degree, using urban building and vegetation height data to represent the 3D structures within urban units. We employed ensemble learning algorithms to explore nonlinear effects and statistical correlations across 20 buffer radii (100 m to 2000 m) related to the UHI effect. The integration of these inhomogeneous indexes substantially improved model accuracy, with XGBoost achieving an R2 of 0.95. The optimal scale for calculating such indexes was found to be between 300 m and 400 m. Our findings suggest optimizing UHI mitigation by lowering the Building Height Coefficient in high-density areas and increasing it in low-density regions. Furthermore, we propose tailoring the Vegetation Height Coefficient for green spaces, advocating higher values for larger parks and lower values for smaller ones. This approach offers practical insights for mitigating urban heat effects through customized morphological strategies, emphasizing the importance of precise urban planning and environmental management. {\copyright} 2023},

We extracted information on 2,118 major urban park green spaces through GIS, and obtained LST and NDVI data by inverting Landsat 8-OLI remote sensing images. Then, we further used SVM to label and identify underlying features of ground, water surfaces, grasslands, trees etc. to establish an urban park database. In UHI analysis, we defined the buffer zone using the ERM method, and the temperature difference obtained was used as the dependent variable for cooling intensity. In terms of data analysis, scikit-learn and Shapley Additive Explanation revealed the contributions of various indicators of park green spaces to alleviating the UHI. Using GeoAI, we combine geographic spatial science and Explainable AI. we established a thermal comfort evaluation model for park green spaces. We found that the area, NDVI, and surrounding FAR of green spaces have a significant impact on cooling intensity, and other indicators such as area, NDVI, TP, and LP also have a certain effective range. This mechanism of influence will provide important directional recommendations for decision-makers in the initial planning and design of future urban park green spaces. {\copyright} 2023, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

Fixed air temperature and humidity measurements at 14 study sites were conducted in Guangzhou continuously from September to November 2016. The daily variation in UHI intensity (UHII) showed a significant U-shape, and that of UMI intensity (UMII) presented two major changes: a decrease after 6:00 and an increase after 19:00. The UHI and UMI effects were more pronounced at night than during the day and were affected by sky conditions with varied solar radiation and cloud cover. A positive relationship between UHII and UMII at night and an opposite one during the day was observed. The mechanisms behind the UHI and UMI formations and their relationship mainly are the differences of land-surface morphology and boundary layer movement between urban and rural sites. The classification of urban form (including blocks and street canyons with different street orientations) significantly improved the performances of the UHII and UMII regression models. The determination coefficients of the UHII (UMII) models ranged from 0.683 to 0.825 (from 0.497 to 0.803) for the overall data and various sky conditions. Furthermore, the critical urban morphological indicators of diurnal and nocturnal UHII were identified. The green cover ratio and albedo were negatively correlated with diurnal and nocturnal UMII, whereas the impervious plan area ratio showed a positive correlation.

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for the assessment of the fundamental value of house prices in the largest Ukrainian cities, as well as to identify the thresholds, the breach of which would signal a bubble. Design/methodology/approach: House price bubbles are detected using two approaches: ratios and regression analysis. Two variants of each method are considered. The authors calculate the price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios that can identify a possible overvaluation or undervaluation of house prices. Then, the authors perform regression analyses by considering individual multi-factor models for each city and by using a within regression model with one-way (individual) effects on panel data. Findings: The only pronounced and prolonged period of a house price bubble is the one that coincides with the Global Financial Crisis. The bubble signals produced by these methods are, on average, simultaneous and in accordance with economic sense. Research limitations/implications: The framework described in this paper can serve as a model for the implementation of a tool for detecting house price bubbles in other countries with emerging, small and open economies, due to adjustments for high inflation and significant dependence on reserve currencies that it incorporates. Practical implications: A tool for measuring fundamental house prices and a bubble indicator for housing markets will be used to monitor the systemic risks stemming from the real estate market. Thus, it will help the National Bank of Ukraine maintain financial stability. Social implications: The framework presented in this research will contribute to the enhancement of the systemic risk analysis toolkit of the National Bank of Ukraine. Therefore, it will help to prevent or mitigate risks that might originate in the real estate market. Originality/value: The authors show how to implement an instrument for detecting house price bubbles in Ukraine. This will become important in the context of the after-war reconstruction of Ukraine, with mortgages potentially becoming the main tool for the financing of the rebuilding/renovation of the residential real estate stock. {\copyright} 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Extreme heat is one of the deadliest health hazards that is projected to increase in intensity and persistence in the near future. Here, we tackle the problem of spatially heterogeneous heat distribution within urban areas. We develop a novel multi-scale metric of identifying emerging heat clusters at various percentile-based thermal thresholds and refer to them collectively as intra-Urban Heat Islets. Using remotely sensed Land Surface Temperatures, we first quantify the spatial organization of heat islets in cities at various degrees of sprawl and densification. We then condense the size, spacing, and intensity information about heterogeneous clusters into probability distributions that can be described using single scaling exponents (denoted by {$\beta$}, {$\Lambda$}s c o r e, and {$\lambda$}, respectively). This allows for a seamless comparison of the heat islet characteristics across cities at varying spatial scales and improves on the traditional Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) Intensity as a bulk metric. Analysis of Heat Islet Size distributions demonstrates the emergence of two classes where the dense cities follow a Pareto distribution, and the sprawling cities show an exponential tempering of Pareto tail. This indicates a significantly reduced probability of encountering large heat islets for sprawling cities. In contrast, analysis of Heat Islet Intensity distributions indicates that while a sprawling configuration is favorable for reducing the mean SUHI Intensity of a city, for the same mean, it also results in higher local thermal extremes. This poses a paradox for urban designers in adopting expansion or densification as a growth trajectory to mitigate the UHI. {\copyright} 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon that can cause hotspots in city areas due to dense, impervious infrastructure and minimal vegetation cover. UHI hotspots may become worse in extreme heat events that are already affecting many regions across the globe due to increased frequent hot extremes, human-induced warming in cities, and rapidly growing urbanization, as documented by the latest IPCC report 2021. In seeking to support designers, planners, and decision-makers in developing and implementing adaptation strategies and measures to make our cities sustainable and resilient, reliable projections and modelling are required. In this study, we modelled UHI vulnerability using high-resolution spatial data, advanced geospatial tools, and socio-demographic data. This modified vulnerability approach drew upon UHI index maps and 20 select customized indicators of heat exposure, population sensitivity, and mobility/adaptive capacity. The indicators were Delphi evaluated and weighted, and the methodology was applied against the City of Greater Geelong municipality in Australia. The resulting UHI index maps indicated significant hotspots in areas of high building density, commercial/industrial zones, newly constructed sites, and zones with low urban green infrastructure. These UHI maps, in combination with selected indicators, highlighted the areal concentration of heat risk areas and vulnerable locations for the sensitive human population. The highlighted areas were primarily concentrated in high building density and high population density areas, which was seen through correlation curves. However, the building density showed a weak correlation, and population per meshblock indicated a strong correlation with UHI measurements. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of risk mapping and vulnerability assessment using GIS geospatial data for the advancement of a major local government area and concludes that this methodology has replicability incomparable geographical regions. {\copyright} 2022, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

A toolset providing quantitative, actionable information on dependencies and trade-offs between upstream and downstream water users is currently lacking. Yet, any intervention needs to be assessed in terms of consequences for downstream water users. This study evaluates the potential of a tracer-like approach, implemented in the water allocation software WEAP, to quantitatively track return flows and their downstream reuse in the river basin context. The WEAP-Virtual Tracer (WEAP-VT) approach was successfully applied to one of Europe's driest river basins, the Segura River Basin in Spain. For each water demand site, the different original sources of water supply, dependency on upstream return flows, and downstream reuse of its return flow were assessed. Based on these results, agricultural, urban, and environmental water users were evaluated in terms of their suitability for water saving measures and their vulnerability to the reduction in upstream return flows. A scenario analysis simulating the improvement of local efficiency improvements shows that specific irrigation schemes and ecosystems become deprived of water. Hence, efficiency improvement in water-scarce basins should be considered with caution. The demonstrated ability to quantify key water reuse indicators for individual water users and at different aggregation levels makes WEAP-VT a valuable tool to support water resource management decisions.},

  abstract = {Africa's unprecedented, uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization has put many African cities under constant ecological and environmental threat. One of the critical ecological impacts of urbanization likely to adversely affect Africa's urban dwellers is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. However, UHI studies in African cities remain uncommon. Therefore, this study attempts to examine the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the spatial patterns, composition and configuration of impervious surfaces/green spaces in four African cities, Lagos (Nigeria), Nairobi (Kenya), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Lusaka (Zambia). Landsat OLI/TIRS data and various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient, urban heat island intensity, statistics and urban landscape metrics-based techniques, were used to facilitate the analysis. The results show significantly strong correlation between mean LST and the density of impervious surface (positive) and green space (negative) along the urban-rural gradients of the four African cities. The study also found high urban heat island intensities in the urban zones close (0 to 10 km) to the city center for all cities. Generally, cities with a higher percentage of the impervious surface were warmer by 3-4 {$^\circ$}C and vice visa. This highlights the crucial mitigating effect of green spaces. We also found significant correlations between the mean LST and urban landscape metrics (patch density, size, shape, complexity and aggregation) of impervious surfaces (positive) and green spaces (negative). The study revealed that, although most African cities have relatively larger green space to impervious surface ratio with most green spaces located beyond the urban footprint, the UHI effect is still evident. We recommend that urban planners and policy makers should consider mitigating the UHI effect by restoring the urban ecosystems in the remaining open spaces in the urban area and further incorporate strategic combinations of impervious surfaces and green spaces in future urban and landscape planning. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

The seasonal and diurnal variation of UHI makes the task of incorporating UHI into BES an especially challenging task, often limited by the availability of detailed hourly temperature data at building location. This paper addresses the temporal variation of UHI by deriving four normalized UHI indicators that can successfully capture the seasonal and diurnal variation of UHI. The accuracy of these indicators was established across four climate types including hot and humid (Miami, FL), hot and dry (Los Angeles, CA), cold and dry (Denver, CO), and cold and humid (Chicago, IL), and three building types including office, hospital, and apartments. These four indicators are mean summer daytime UHI, mean summer nighttime UHI, mean winter daytime UHI, and mean winter nighttime UHI, which can accurately predict cooling, heating, and annual energy consumption with mean relative error of less than 1},

This study uses 2011 data to investigate GHG emissions from electricity use for urban water supply in China. The objective is to measure the climate cobenefit of water conservation, compare China with other areas on a number of emissions indicators, and assist in development of policy that promotes low-emission water supply. Per capita and per unit GHG emissions for water supplied to urban areas in China in 2011 were 24.5kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2-eq) per capita per year and 0.213kg CO2-eq per cubic meter, respectively. Comparison of provinces within China revealed that GHG emissions for urban water supply as a percentage of total province-wide emissions from electricity use correlate directly with the rate of leakage and water loss within the water distribution system. This highlights controlling leakage as a possible means of reducing the contribution of urban water supply to GHG emissions. An inverse correlation was established between GHG emissions per unit water and average per capita daily water use, which implies that water demand tends to be higher when per unit emissions are lower. China's high emission factor for electricity generation inflates emissions for urban water supply. Shifting from emissions-intensive electricity sources is crucial to reducing emissions in the water supply sector.}

In this study, energy data from 2011 was used to quantify energy use in China's urban water supply sector. The objective was to calculate the energy co-benefits of urban water conservation policies and compare energy use between China and other countries. The study investigated influencing factors with the aim of informing the development of energy efficient urban water infrastructure. The average energy use per cubic metre and per capita for urban water supply in China in 2011 was 0.29 kWh/m(3) and 33.2 kWh/cap year, respectively. Total GHG emissions associated with energy use in the urban water supply sector were 7.63 MtCO(2)e, or carbon dioxide equivalent. Calculations using these indicators showed significant energy savings could result from water conservation measures. A comparison between provinces of China showed a direct correlation between energy intensity of urban water supply and the population served per unit length of pipe. This may imply energy and emission intensity can be reduced if more densely populated areas are supplied by a corresponding pipe density, rather than by a low-density network operating at higher flow rates. This study also found that while the percentage of electrical energy used for urban water supply tended to increase with the percentage of population served, this increase was slower where water supply was more energy efficient and where a larger percentage of population was already supplied.}

  abstract = {Determining the optimal planning scale for urban life circles and analyzing the associated built environment factors are crucial for comprehending and regulating residential differentiation. This study aims to bridge the current research void concerning the nonlinear hierarchical relationships between the built environment and residential differentiation under the multiscale effect. Specifically, six indicators were derived from urban crowdsourcing data: diversity of built environment function (DBEF1), density of built environment function (DBEF2), blue-green environment (BGE), traffic accessibility (TA), population vitality (PV), and shopping vitality (SV). Then, a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) was applied to derive the analysis of these indicators. Finally, the interpretability of machine learning was leveraged to quantify the relative importance and nonlinear relationships between built environment indicators and housing prices. The results indicate a hierarchical structure and inflection point effect of the built environment on residential premiums. Notably, the impact trend of the built environment on housing prices within a 15 min life circle remains stable. The effect of crowd behavior, as depicted by PV and SV, on housing prices emerges as the most significant factor. Furthermore, this study also categorizes housing into common and high-end residences, thereby unveiling that distinct residential neighborhoods exhibit varying degrees of dependence on the built environment. The built environment exerts a scale effect on the formation of residential differentiation, with housing prices exhibiting increased sensitivity to the built environment at a smaller life circle scale. Conversely, the effect of the built environment on housing prices is amplified at a larger life circle scale. Under the dual influence of the scale and hierarchical effect, this framework can dynamically adapt to the uncertainty of changes in life circle planning policies and residential markets. This provides strong theoretical support for exploring the optimal life circle scale, alleviating residential differentiation, and promoting group fairness.},

For the analysis, a set of cause-effect indicators is applied following the framework of reference Drivers - Pressures-State- Impact and Response (DPSIR). One of the limitations detected is the difficulty in collecting data given the large number of continental water exploitation systems in the Demarcation. The socioeconomic results evaluated indicate the big bet for an economy of the service sector, which has meant a coastal population increase and the progressive abandonment of the agricultural sector. In all the islands, although at different percentage levels, there has been detected overexploitation, salinisation and contamination of some of their groundwater body masses. The current model of development, in order to avoid risks of the resource and guarantee autonomy and security in the supply, requires mid-scale adaptations from an approach of progress towards integration and moderation in growth, obeying the environmental objectives proposed by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in the foreseen terms. {\copyright} 2020 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

  abstract = {Due to climate change and a growing urban population worldwide, cities as heat islands are of increasing concern for the health and living comfort of urban populations. Accordingly, thermal comfort is an important element of bioclimatic design within cities, and areas with an abundance of hard surfaces, and a lack of tree shade, can become uncomfortably hot in summer periods, which can negatively alter usage patterns of these spaces and even become an issue of human health. In this context, a pilot study was undertaken to assess if thermal photography of the forehead of an individual can be a reliable, non-invasive, rapid tool to predict outdoor thermal comfort. A combination of street interviews, micrometeorological measurements and facial thermography was used with 775 volunteers on warm summer days in the city of Bolzano (N Italy). Two locations were chosen with contrasting sky view factors and tree shade amounts. A large difference in the mean radiant temperature, and Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI), between the two locations resulted in higher thermal sensation votes and higher levels of discomfort in the space without tree shade. The mean average forehead temperature was 1.5 {$^\circ$}C higher in the treeless space (35.2 {$^\circ$}C) compared to the shaded space (33.7 {$^\circ$}C). Forehead temperatures correlated significantly positively with UTCI (treeless: r = 0.30, p {\textexclamdown} 0.001; shaded: r = 0.21, p {\textexclamdown} 0.001) and air temperature (treeless: r = 0.28, p {\textexclamdown} 0.001; shaded: r = 0.22, p {\textexclamdown} 0.001). Thermal comfort was successfully predicted from forehead temperatures in the treeless space using a logistic regression model, however low R2 values limit the predictive power of these models. Facial thermography shows promise as a proxy for thermal comfort in thermally stressful spaces. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This study addressed these limitations by comparing two relatively new MCDM methods, MOOORA and MAIRCA, for ranking urban water utilities in India. Both methods were illustrated for ranking 20 urban water supply utilities in India based on 13 indicators. {\copyright} 2023}

The second part focuses on access to public utilities: water, sanitation, natural gas, electricity and the Internet. The third part looks into the policy and financing concerning living conditions in rural areas. We use national time series, objective data from census and statistical surveys for observing long term trends. Cross-sectional, objective data from European statistical surveys is used for international comparisons. According to the main findings, living conditions in rural areas in Romania experienced a marked improvement over the thirty year period, especially in terms of reduced housing overcrowding, increased access to water, sanitation, and the Internet. However, this statement requires nuances and caveats. Despite the progress made, the gap compared to Western Europe persists. The suburbanisation of rural areas and the variance between and within communes in terms of dwellings' access to water, sanitation, and natural gas are two trends that point to the increased heterogeneity of rural communities in Romania. Looking forward, there are sustainability and affordability risks concerning the expansion of public utilities in rural areas. {\copyright} 2021, Editura Academiei Romane. All rights reserved.},

Heatwaves' implications are escalated in urban environments due to the intensification of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. To combat the overheating and UHI adverse effects, novel urban rehabilitation actions are needed based on reliable predictions of appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (such as pedestrian-level air temperature and thermal comfort) for alternative design scenarios. The objective of the current study is to present the application of a previously developed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the calculation of urban microclimatic conditions for the assessment of the UHI and thermal-comfort conditions in a central urban area in the city of Heraklion in Crete, Greece. Empirical validation of the model is performed through comparisons with monitored microclimate data (i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) and actual sensation vote recordings found in another research study. In compliance with the latter, the validation campaign is conducted for a typical hot summer day in July 2009 from 10:00 to 16:00. The model is then used to assess the UHI effects for both the existing urban configuration and a given suggested environmental upgrade of the space. Simulations of the existing situation reveal that the squares located in the studied area already stand for efficient resistances to urban overheating, and heat vulnerabilities are detected mainly in non-shaded traffic and pedestrian roads perimetric to the squares. Based on the CFD simulations, the suggested environmental upgrading plan exhibits a reduction in the peak mean air temperature of 0.46 \& DEG;C, and thermal comfort is improved by at least 5},

Design/methodology/approach: The econometric analysis includes stationarity test, Granger causality test, correlation analysis, linear and non-linear regression modes, threshold regression and autoregressive distributed lag models. The analysis is performed based on 137 external factors that can be grouped into macroeconomic, business, financial, real estate market, labour market indicators and expectations. Findings: The research reveals that housing price largely depends on macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and consumer spending. Cash and deposits of households are the most important indicators from the group of financial indicators. The impact of financial, business and labour market indicators on housing price varies depending on the stage of the economic cycle. Practical implications: Real estate market experts and policymakers can monitor the changes in external factors that have been identified as key indicators of housing prices. Based on that, they can prepare for the changes in the real estate market better and take the necessary decisions in a timely manner, if necessary. Originality/value: This study considerably adds to the existing literature by providing a better understanding of external factors that affect the housing price in Lithuania and let predict the changes in the real estate market. It is beneficial for policymakers as it lets them choose reasonable decisions aiming to stabilize the real estate market. {\copyright} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We use Malaysian data from the Department of Statistics, National Property Information Centre, and Central Bank of Malaysia. The findings show that Melaka has a high level of housing affordability, whilst Sabah had a low level of housing affordability. Meanwhile, the bottom 40 percent (B40) of income group was detected to have very poor home affordability compared to that of middle 40 percent (M40) and top 20 percent (T20) groups in Malaysia. It further capture the level of unaffordability among the B40 segment of the population, which was lacking in previous studies. This study contributes to the literature by incorporating the financial element into the formulation of the index namely, the household income, house price, and loan rate. This is to ensure that the reliability and validity of the formula developed. This research benefits various stakeholders by providing a refined and better housing affordability index that can be utilized as a benchmark for certain levels of housing affordability. {\copyright} 2024 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

In this paper, four typical blocks were selected to simulate the microclimate by ENVI-met, and the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was calculated. Through the simplified model, the thermal comfort building strategy suitable for Dalian was explored, and the effectiveness was verified. The results show that direct solar radiation and wind speed are the critical factors for the thermal comfort of the settlements residents. The building orientation, sunshine spacing coefficient, and building layout will affect the thermal environment of the block through these two factors. The outdoor thermal environment in Dalian can be improved by adjusting the orientation of buildings away from the traditional south direction, increasing the sunshine spacing coefficient, dislocating buildings, or adopting a peripheral-type building layout. This study can provide a scientific basis for building healthy and comfortable urban living environments and block development and renovation decisions. {\copyright} 2021},

Methods: A spatial regression model was developed to examine the associations between urban heritage sites and their corresponding protected areas as the independent variables (nationally assigned cultural heritage, city-assigned cultural heritage, nationally registered cultural heritage, nationally assigned cultural heritage protected area, and city-assigned cultural heritage protected area) and residential environmental satisfaction and housing prices as the dependent variables. The model investigated how urban heritage sites influence housing prices through the mediating effect of residential environmental satisfaction. Results: The results confirmed the impact of urban heritage sites on housing prices and the mediating effect of residential environmental satisfaction. Moreover, depending on their urban heritage classifications, noticeable differences were evident in the impact of urban heritage sites. Conclusion: These findings provide an intellectual foundation for public policies, offering insights into how they might achieve an optimum balance between private and public interests in matters of heritage conservation. {\copyright} 2022 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.},

First, we analyze the correlation between three metrics describing poly-centricity and surface urban heat islands (SUHI) at the urban scale, taking into account diurnal and seasonal differences. Second, we examine the surface temperature difference between the main center and subcenter(s) as well as its possible influencing factors. Third, we use structural equation modeling to quantitatively confirm the mechanism behind the relationship between polycentric structure and SUHI. The results show that: (1) There is a significant positive correlation between polycentricity and daytime SHUI, regardless of the season. However, the relationship is insignificant during summer nighttime, and it even becomes negative during winter nighttime. (2) The majority of the main centers experience more severe thermal challenges. (3) Climate, urban size, vegetation, and industry are the mediators of the relationship between SUHI and polycentric structure during summer daytime. Our findings provide valuable insights for understanding thermal environment under polycentric development and can be used as a reference for proposing thermal mitigation strategies for cities that are or are becoming polycentric.},

  abstract = {Cool pavements represent one of several strategies that can mitigate the effects of urban overheating by increasing albedo. By definition, this means increasing reflected and potentially re-absorbed short-wave radiation but also decreased surface and air temperatures and longwave upwelling, thus reducing radiant temperatures. So far, real-world studies have been inconclusive as to net effects from cool pavements. A project by GAF installed reflective pavements in Pacoima, California, in summer of 2022. This study set out to perform detailed, high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-platform observations to quantify micrometeorological benefits of the cool pavements and address concerns regarding glare, chemistry/air quality, and pedestrian thermal comfort. Results indicated large variability, as expected, but that the dominant effects were beneficial both in direct side-by-side, real-time comparisons (RT) between test and reference areas, as well as in difference-of-difference (DofD) to quantify local changes in test areas. During a heatwave in September 2022, maximum air-temperature differences (averaged over individual street segments) reached up to -1.9 degrees C RT in the afternoon. During non-heatwave, hot summer days, the largest street-segment-averaged afternoon air-temperature differences reached up to -1.4 degrees C RT or -2.8 degrees C DofD, and surface temperature up to -9.2 degrees C RT or -12.2 degrees C DofD. Whereas above values represent maximum effects, more typical street-segment averages also showed statistically significant benefits. In the afternoon, the mean of air-temperature differences was -0.2 degrees C RT and -1.2 degrees C DofD. The mean of surface-temperature differences was -2.6 degrees C RT and -4.9 degrees C DofD. Indicators of pedestrian thermal comfort also showed variability but predominantly a cooling effect. The mean of differences in mean radiant temperature was between -0.9 and -1.3 degrees C RT, and for physiological equivalent temperature, between -0.2 degrees C and -0.6 degrees C RT and -1.7 degrees C DofD. In terms of predicted mean vote, the mean of differences was -0.09 RT and -0.32 DofD.},

Case studies are conducted to evaluate the effects of the implementation of a cool water circulation sunshade and to examine the adverse effects of cool pavements on the human thermal environment, in addition to the effects of mist sprays on the human body. The effect of the sunshade, watering road, and mist spray, which are typical adaptation measures to urban heat islands, on the human thermal environment was estimated using Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) as an indicator for heat stroke prevention and Standard New Effective Temperature (SET*) as an indicator for thermal comfort assessment. The effect of solar radiation shielding on improving the human thermal environment was the most significant, with a large decrease in the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the human body, resulting in a large decrease in SET* and WBGT of 2.7 {$^\circ$}C and 1.0 {$^\circ$}C, respectively, on fine summer days. {\copyright} 2024 by the author.},

  abstract = {This study attempted to classify blocks in the second ring road of Changsha, a central city of urban agglomeration in central China, according to their green space patterns, and to explore the influence of green spaces in different blocks on the surrounding microclimate. Researchers divided the blocks into five types: green space enclosed by buildings type, green space parallel with buildings type, green space centralized in buildings type, green space interspersed in the block type, and green space dispersed in the block type. Thermal comfort conditions in the different blocks were studied by ENVI-met simulations and using the thermal comfort indicators physiological equivalent temperature (PET), predicted mean vote (PMV), and standard effective temperature (SET). Because the green space was more evenly distributed in the block of green space parallel type and green space interspersed type, the overall fluctuation of the thermal comfort value of all areas of the whole block was small, with more areas having a value close to the median value of the thermal comfort value of the block. In the green enclosed blocks, thermal comfort was better within the green space in the area enclosed in the middle when the surrounding buildings were lower. The green areas in the green space enclosure type significantly improved the thermal comfort around the buildings, and the thermal comfort in the areas decreased rapidly as the distance between the green areas and the buildings increased. The green space dispersion type was found more in older blocks that were not well planned and had poor thermal comfort in the areas. On the premise that the green space area in the different high-rise blocks was equal, if only the thermal comfort of the green space coverage area was considered, in the summer, the green space parallel type was the best ({\textbar}Delta PET{\textbar} = 7.96, {\textbar}Delta PMV{\textbar} = 1.22). In the winter, the green space centralized type was the best ({\textbar}Delta PET{\textbar} = 11.26, {\textbar}Delta SET{\textbar} = 10.88). On the premise of equal green space area in the different multilayer blocks, if only the thermal comfort of green space coverage area was considered, in the summer, the green space parallel type was the best ({\textbar}Delta PET{\textbar} = 8.89, {\textbar}Delta PMV{\textbar} = 1.49). In the winter, the green space centralized type ({\textbar}Delta PET{\textbar} = 11.04, {\textbar}Delta SET{\textbar} = 10.64) was the best. This shows that different greening patterns have different advantages and disadvantages in different seasons and different situations.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research was to examine the influence of urban configuration on the mitigation of land surface temperature (LST) and the prediction of land use and land cover change through the utilization of convolutional neural network modeling. The results indicate that the formation of different urban heat island patterns is significantly influenced by both urban geometry and land use land cover (LULC) types. However, there is no significant correlation between these factors and LST across all configuration metrics. The associations between landscape configuration and land cover types exhibit variability contingent upon the particular forest cover categories under examination. Furthermore, the application of predictive LULC mapping reveals a divergent pattern, characterized by a rise in the overall extent of vegetation but a decline in the inner context of the Shiraz metropolitan area. The projected trajectory of built-up areas indicates a continued trend of urban expansion. The unique landscape patterns are a result of the distinct characteristics of each LULC. According to recommendations, to address the issue of mean LST, it is advisable for urban landscape planning to give priority to cohesion, density, and continuity while simultaneously minimizing fragmentation, variability, and complexity. This research provides valuable insights into the following aspects for urban planners, policymakers, and practitioners to address the following. (1) Selecting appropriate landscape metrics: this study identifies suitable landscape metrics to represent and interpret different landscape structures and land use land cover changes (LULCCs) over time. (2) Understanding regional variations: this research highlights that different landscape metrics have distinct effectiveness in different regions. This knowledge helps urban planners and policymakers to tailor their strategies and interventions based on specific regional characteristics, ensuring more effective mitigation of the urban heat island effect. (3) Different correlations with configuration metrics: this study reveals that the correlations between landscape configuration and LST differ in land cover types. (4) Anticipating future changes: this research utilizes machine learning models to predict future LULCC and landscape metrics. This information is valuable for urban planners and policymakers in anticipating and preparing for future urban expansion and changes in vegetation areas. It enables them to proactively design and implement strategies to manage the surface urban heat island effect. Urban planners and policymakers can utilize these insights to develop comprehensive strategies that integrate land-use design, landscape configuration, and urban form to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization.},

Several researchers have evaluated water supply services' performance at the national, state, regional and city level; however, challenges remain to solve inequitable distribution of water supply services at the intra-city level. The current research evaluated water supply services' performance through geospatial techniques in 141 water supply zones in Pune city. We computed performance indicators and water indexes for each water supply zone, analyzed spatially, and compared each zone based on the performance for water supply services. The results found that 50\% of the city's total water supply zones are high-performing, 26\% medium-performing, and 24\% low-performing zones for their water supply services.

In this study, the degree of sustainable water resource utilization in Harbin City from 2014 to 2021 was calculated using a fuzzy identification model with a combination of the "sequential relationship analysis method (G1) and coefficient of variation method (CVM)" and 18 evaluation indicators retrieved for water resources, reflecting social, economic, and ecological aspects. The study shows that (1) in terms of the research method, the combined weighting of "G1-CVM" is a feasible approach to avoid the shortcomings of single weighting and (2) in terms of the evaluation of water resources sustainable utilization, the spatial distribution of water resources in each district (county) of Harbin City has been stable over the past 8 years. The spatial distribution pattern is relatively stable, with the three regions of Binxian, Bayan, and Shuangcheng showing better sustainable water resource utilization and the three regions of Tonghe County, including the main urban area and Wuchang City, showing deteriorating sustainable water resource utilization. As a whole, the spatial distribution of sustainable water resources in the 13 districts (counties) of Harbin City from 2014 to 2021 shows a negative correlation, with the main urban area, Wuchang City, Hulan District, Bayan County, Shuangcheng District, and Yilan County showing a clustering type in the local spatial autocorrelation analysis. Based on the evaluation results, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the sustainable use of water resources in Harbin are identified and found to be conducive to the timely adjustment of water resources allocation and the rational use of water resources in each district (county). Meanwhile, the research ideas and methods used in this paper can be applied to research on the sustainable use of water resources in other regions.},

In this study, scenic open spaces in an urban area of Xi'an, China were selected. Thermal perception (thermal sensation, comfort and acceptability) of residents and tourists were investigated through meteorological measurement and questionnaire survey. Physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was used to determine thermal benchmarks of all visitors to the site. Variables that influence individual thermal perception assessment (physical, individual, society and psychology) were measured and compared. Finally, a series of strategies and suggestions were proposed based on meteorological characteristics and influencing factors of thermal perception from perspectives of designers and scenic spot managers. Results show that: 1) Neutral PET (NPET) of respondents were 17.3 {$^\circ$}C (residents) and 15.5 {$^\circ$}C (tourists). Neutral PET ranges (NPETR) were 8.9--25.8 {$^\circ$}C (residents) and 7.2--23.8 {$^\circ$}C (tourists). Preferred PET values were 20.1 {$^\circ$}C (residents) and 19.7 {$^\circ$}C (tourists). Thermal acceptability ranges (TAR) were 6.3--37.8 {$^\circ$}C (residents) and 0.5--39.9 {$^\circ$}C (tourists). 2) In winter, physical factors were primary influencers of residents' thermal perception, followed by social factors, while tourists' thermal perception was mainly influenced by physical factors. In spring, physical factors were still the primary influencers for residents, followed by individual factors. Physical factors were also dominant for tourists, followed by psychological. In summer, physical factors were the major influencing factors for residents and tourists' thermal perceptions. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The use of indicators to analyze changes has been widely accepted; however, until now these indicators have been developed mainly on a large scale, omitting to attend to specific local characteristics and problems. Therefore, this paper develops a framework of indicators to be used as a tool in the IUWM, applied to the case study of Mexico City in the period 2005-2018. The conceptual and methodological framework adopted is based on the principles of IUWM and the Pressure-State-Response causality approach. The formulation of the framework was carried out in five stages. As a result, a set of 12 indicators is presented, divided into four subgroups: (1) operational efficiency to meet drinking water and sanitation service needs; (2) pressure on the water resource that affects water availability and quality; (3) the environmental status of the resource; and (4) society's response to reduce pressures and improve water quality and quantity. For each indicator, its basic attributes were delimited and values were calculated, demonstrating its viability as a public policy evaluation tool in the monitoring stage of the IUWM. {\copyright} 2020 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

While the previous research on affordability and water tariff setting is substantial, the interplay of water access equity and its impact on household water expenditure is less understood due to the absence of granular household level data in India.

Using regression analysis, this paper investigates the association between the socio-economic, tenurial status, sources of water, sufficiency, and access related factors and the household expenditure on water. Results show that water is a scarce commodity for lower sections of society and that they are incurring higher costs, making the water relatively unaffordable.

This paper uses Taiwan's largest industrial city (Kaohsiung) as an example to discuss the negative spillover effect brought about by its most polluted industrial area (the Kaohsiung Linhai Industrial Park, KLIP). This study finds that the proximity between residences and the pollution sources and air pollution severity both cause housing prices to decrease. The results also show that among different air pollution indicators, SO2 concentration exerts the largest influence on housing prices. This may be because the SO2 emitted by large coal-fired power plants and oil refineries in the KLIP is linked to pollution-based haze and creates a visible atmospheric brown haze. By discussing the industrial park's air pollution problem, this paper illustrates the harm of the overdevelopment of an industrial park. To prevent people's relocation events resulting from the overdevelopment of an industrial park occurring in the future, we must regularly estimate the shadow price that residents living near the industrial park are required to pay to escape air pollution. This paper also puts forward suggestions that contribute to the sustainable development of industrial parks. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

Based on the literature on the relationship between short-term mobility and long-term migration, this paper illustrates that the extent to which people use trains for travel across regions will be related to the ripple effect in the regional housing markets. Frequent railway transport behavior, whether for commuting or traveling, might increase people's desire to relocate between regions, and thus leading to information transmission effects across regional housing prices and transaction volume. First, we estimate a dynamic indicator for the ripple effect. Then, the empirical tests use panel data, including the ripple indicator and passenger number data across time (1996--2022) and regions (nine regions). It is found that if London house prices drive other regional house prices to rise, inter-regional transportation demand will increase, and in turn, the increase of house prices in other housing markets will again drive up London house prices. The number of passengers will affect the information transmitted by the housing market transaction volume in other regions to the London housing market. This implies that higher inter-regional transport needs may lead to migration between London and other property markets, causing their transaction volumes to change in the same direction. The results of this paper verify that travel behavior between regions is a crucial factor in the leading/lagging behavior of regional housing market performance, implying a relationship between short-term travel and long-term migration. The results also indicate that incorporating variables of housing market correlations may help in the prediction of passenger numbers or transportation demand. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The results show that although neighbourhood attachment (NA) is an important component of urban local identity, now more than NA, upkeep and care (UC) create a local identity.

The City Blueprint is a set of 24 dedicated indicators divided over 8 categories (i.e., water security, water quality, drinking water, sanitation, infrastructure, climate robustness, biodiversity and attractiveness, and governance including public participation). The analysis showed that the rapid increase of water use for urban, industrial, and agricultural activities in HCMC has resulted in depletion of groundwater and severe pollution of both groundwater and surface water. Surface water quality, groundwater quality, biodiversity, and the sanitation of domestic and industrial wastewater are matters that need serious improvement. Current and future water supply in HCMC is at risk. HCMC can cope with it, but the 7 governance gaps as described by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are major obstacles for HCMC. Rainwater harvesting, pollution reduction, as well as wastewater reuse are among the practical options. Wastewater reuse could lower the water stress index to 10\%. The window to do this is narrow and rapidly closing as a result of the unprecedented urbanization and economic growth of this region. {\copyright} 2016 SETAC.}

  abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this paper is to examine the determinants of the Greek house market during the period 2006--2022 using not only economic variables but also behavioral variables, taking advantage of available information on the volume of Google searches. In order to quantify the behavioral variables, we implement a Python code using the Pytrends 4.9.2 library. Design/methodology/approach: In our study, we assert that models relying solely on economic variables, such as GDP growth, mortgage interest rates and inflation, may lack precision compared to those that integrate behavioral indicators. Recognizing the importance of behavioral insights, we incorporate Google Trends data as a key behavioral indicator, aiming to enhance our understanding of market dynamics by capturing online interest in Greek real estate through searches related to house prices, sales and related topics. To quantify our behavioral indicators, we utilize a Python code leveraging Pytrends, enabling us to extract relevant queries for global and local searches. We employ the EGARCH(1,1) model on the Greek house price index, testing several macroeconomic variables alongside our Google Trends indexes to explain housing returns. Findings: Our findings show that in some cases the relationship between economic variables, such as inflation and mortgage rates, and house prices is not always consistent with the theory because we should highlight the special conditions of the examined country. The country of our sample, Greece, presents the special case of a country with severe sovereign debt issues, which at the same time has the privilege to have a strong currency and the support and the obligations of being an EU/EMU member. Practical implications: The results suggest that Google Trends can be a valuable tool for academics and practitioners in order to understand what drives house prices. However, further research should be carried out on this topic, for example, causality relationships, to gain deeper insight into the possibilities and limitations of using such tools in analyzing housing market trends. Originality/value: This is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, that examines the benefits of Google Trends in studying the Greek house market. {\copyright} 2024, Evangelos Vasileiou, Elroi Hadad and Georgios Melekos.},

Metabolism-based modelling, which can quantify various flows within an urban water system (UWS), has shown its effective usability for a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of intervention strategies and can be used by any water utility for future planning of UWS. This study presents the main principles of a holistic Sustainability Assessment Framework which can be simulated by using two analytical, conceptual, mass-balance-based models to quantify relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with the metabolic flows of the urban water cycle. These two models are WaterMet2 (WM2) and dynamic metabolism model (DMM), developed recently under the aegis of the EU TRUST (Transitions to the Urban Water Services of Tomorrow) project. There are clear differences between the two models which make them useful in different contexts and circumstantial situations. DMM is a mass-balance consistent model which quantifies and presents annually-aggregated performance values for system wide energy consumption, emissions, environmental impacts and costs for the entire UWS though it is also possible to derive corresponding indicators for individual sub-systems (e.g. water distribution and wastewater transport). WM2 is the opposite of this, it is a distributed metabolism model which simulates water related and other resource flows throughout the UWS components with a higher resolution both spatially (e.g. multiple water resources and service reservoirs) and temporally (e.g. daily and monthly), and thereby is useful in contexts where utilities would like to focus on further details of the UWS metabolism with the aim to understand and solve specific problems. Overall, these two complementary metabolism-based approaches enable any water utility to quantitatively explore and understand the influences of different external drivers and intervention strategies on future performance profiles linked to any physical, environmental and economic criteria. {\copyright} 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Climate models' outputs are affected by biases that need to be detected and adjusted to model climate impacts. Many climate hazards and climate-related impacts are associated with the interaction between multiple drivers, i.e. by compound events. So far climate model biases are typically assessed based on the hazard of interest, and it is unclear how much a potential bias in the dependence of the hazard drivers contributes to the overall bias and how the biases in the drivers interact. Here, based on copula theory, we develop a multivariate bias-assessment framework, which allows for disentangling the biases in hazard indicators in terms of the underlying univariate drivers and their statistical dependence. Based on this framework, we dissect biases in fire and heat stress hazards in a suite of global climate models by considering two simplified hazard indicators: the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and the Chandler burning index (CBI). Both indices solely rely on temperature and relative humidity. The spatial pattern of the hazard indicators is well represented by climate models. However, substantial biases exist in the representation of extreme conditions, especially in the CBI (spatial average of absolute bias: 21g C) due to the biases driven by relative humidity (20g C). Biases in WBGT (1.1g C) are small compared to the biases driven by temperature (1.9g C) and relative humidity (1.4g C), as the two biases compensate for each other. In many regions, also biases related to the statistical dependence (0.85g C) are important for WBGT, which indicates that well-designed physically based multivariate bias adjustment procedures should be considered for hazards and impacts that depend on multiple drivers. The proposed compound-event-oriented evaluation of climate model biases is easily applicable to other hazard types. Furthermore, it can contribute to improved present and future risk assessments through increasing our understanding of the biases' sources in the simulation of climate impacts. {\copyright} Copyright:},

During the past few decades, many different concepts about the urban sustainability under the threats of climate change (CC) have been studied. Resilience is among the most recent concepts, used for the first time in the 2000s and has ever since attracted greater attention and interests from both academia and urban authorities, and has subsequently applied in urban planning. In order to develop and manage cities to be resilient, many studies show that the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) could be useful to architects, urban planners and municipalities in the urban planning process. This study selected the case of capital city Phan Rang-Thap Cham, the most urbanized area of Ninh Thuan province, in the center of Vietnam; it has been known as one of the coastal cities that are affected by CC, drought, storms, floods and sea level rise. Among those phenomena, drought---the most serious hazard was picked up for exploration recently. We utilized RS and GIS to examine city's Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), then extract the most relevant drought-induced factors in the years of 1991, 1997 and 2019, such as: Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The study results show inter-relationships and transformations of the three indicators in Ninh Thuan context, where urban land temperature and Urban Heat Island (UHI) are raised by built-up areas and in contrast, reduced by vegetated areas. As a result, urban green spaces would be a driver to mitigate urban heat and moving toward drought resilience. {\copyright} Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

The primary aim of this paper is to develop an index-based housing affordability indicator known as the housing affordability leading index (HALI), which is based on the indicator compilation approach founded by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The time-varying Markov switching (TVMS) model is then employed to assess the transition probabilities of the constructed housing affordability indicator. The transition probabilities estimate the prospects of the housing affordability condition and how long it will stay in that particular condition before having any major turnover. As the data employed was monthly data from year 2000 to year 2015, the constructed HALI successfully reflects the prior movements of the non-index housing affordability indicator price to income ratios (PIR). The empirical results show that the HALI has an average leading period of 9.5 months when taking the PIR as a benchmark of coincidence indicator for housing affordability movement. {\copyright} 2020 Malaysian Economic Association.

However, knowledge of quantitative microclimatic conditions within the urban boundary layer in the future is still lacking, such that the introduction of adequate adaptation measures to increase OTC is challenging. To investigate the cooling performance of a water spraying system in a sub-tropical compact and high-rise built environment in summer under the influence of future (2050) climatic conditions, results from two validated models (Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) and ENVI-met models) have been used and analyzed. Our results indicate that the spraying system provides cooling of 2-3 degrees C for ambient air temperature at the pedestrian-level of the urban canyons considered here, which benefits pedestrians. However, improvement of the OTC in terms of the physiological equivalent temperature (PET-a better indicator of human thermal sensation) was noticeable (e.g., {\textexclamdown}42 degrees C or from very hot to hot) when the urban canyon was orientated parallel to the prevailing wind direction only. This implies that in order to improve city resilience in terms of heat stress, more holistic adaptation measures in urban planning are needed. This includes the introduction of more breezeways and building disposition to facilitate the urban ventilation, as well as urban tree arrangement and sunshades to reduce direct solar radiation to plan for the impact of future climate change.},

An indicator of remaining tolerant heat discomfort (R-t) was proposed with the integration of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) to assess heat-related walkability. Following an empirical study among 128 residents in Mianyang, China, and assessing four levels of heat stress, the maximum tolerant heat discomfort was determined to be 60 min. Furthermore, the DAM was applied to an FMC with 12 neighborhoods in Fucheng, Mianyang, China. The results indicate that for each neighborhood, the street was generally walkable with an R-t ranging between 15 and 30 min, after walking for 900 m. A population-based FMC walkability was further determined, finding that the core area of the FMC was favorable for walking with an R(t)of 45-46 min, and the perpetual areas were also walkable with an R(t)of 15-30 min. Based on these results, suggestions on the frequency of public services (frequently used, often used, and occasionally used) planning were presented. Overall, this paper provides a theoretical model for analyzing walkability and outlines meaningful implications for planning heat adaptation in resilient, safe, comfortable, and livable FMCs.},

  abstract = {The mitigation strategy study of urban heat island (UHI) provides a key indicator for achieving sustainable development, particularly for cities enduring rapid urbanization. The spatial and temporal variations of land cover were investigated by analyzing the local climate zones (LCZs) in selected years (2008, 2013, 2018). The results demonstrated that the dominant type of built-up land cover LCZs changed from open mid-rise (LCZ 5) to open high-rise (LCZ 4). Additionally, almost all types of natural land cover LCZs presented a downward trend, except for ``dense trees'' (LCZ A). Comparing the land cover variations with the calculated UHI intensity in the corresponding years, an increased intensity in UHI (from 3.0 {$^\circ$}C to 3.3 {$^\circ$}C) was observed from 2008 to 2013. In contrast, the UHI intensity reduced to 3.1 {$^\circ$}C from 2013 to 2018 with an even stronger urbanization process. The transition of land cover varied with the city's development goal, which changed from ``building a modern city'' to ``forming a livable city.'' The evidence that the UHI intensity was relieved by promoting the open arrangement of LCZs and the recovering of ``green'' eco-system suggest a potential strategy to achieve sustainable development for rapid urbanization. {\copyright} 2023},

Focused on the relative heat effect produced by different social-economic functions, this study established a general framework for functional construction land zones (FCLZs) mapping and investigated their heterogeneous contribution to the urban thermal environment, and then the thermal responses in FCLZs with 12 environmental indicators were analyzed. Taking Shenzhen as an example city, the results show that the total contribution and thermal effects within FCLZs are significantly different. Specifically, the FCLZs contribution to UHI regions highly exceeds the corresponding proportions of their area. The median warming capacity order of FCLZs is: Manufacture function (3.99{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Warehousing and logistics function (3.69{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Street and transportation function (3.61{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Business services function (3.06{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Administration and public services function (2.54{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Green spaces and squares function (2.40{$^\circ$}C) {\textquestiondown} Residential function (2.21{$^\circ$}C). Both difference and consistency coexist in the responses of differential surface temperature (DST) to environmental indicators in FCLZs. The thermal responses of DST to biophysical and building indicators in groups of FCLZs are approximately consistent linear relationships with different intercepts, while the saturation effects shown in location and social-economic indicators indicate that distance and social-economic development control UHI effects in a non-linear way. This study could extend the understanding of urban thermal warming mechanisms and help to scientifically adjust environmental indicators in urban planning. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we introduce online listing information as an innovative data source for house price index construction, using China's housing resale markets as an example. Compared with alternative data sources, such as the officially-registered transaction information of housing resales, our analysis shows that online listing data provide a better trade-off between accuracy, reliability, and feasibility, especially after the resolution of potential replicated and/or manipulated data issues using our proposed procedures. Based on the cleaned online listing information, we calculate the first housing resale price indices covering almost all (274) Chinese cities. In particular, for around 200 relatively smaller cities, the index provides the first regular house price indicator, which shows a significant divergence in house price dynamics between different tiers of cities. We also briefly discuss the potential extensions of the listing price index, including the daily house price index and the housing rental price index. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

However, due to the complex nature of influencing factors and the sparse property of transaction records, to implement such a model is still challenging. To address these challenges, in this work, we study an effective and fine-grained model for urban subregion housing price predictions. Compared to existing works, our proposal improves the forecasting granularity from city-level to mile-level, with only publicly released transaction data. We employ a feature selection mechanism to select more relevant features. Then, we propose an integrated model, JGC\_MMN (Joint Gated Co-attention Based Multi-modal Network), to learn all-level features and capture spatiotemporal correlations in all-time stages with a modified densely connected convolutional network as well as current ingredients and future expectations. Next, we devise a novel JGC based fusion method to better fuse the heterogeneous data of multi-stage models by considering their interactions in temporal dimension. Finally, extensive empirical studies on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, and this fine-grained housing price forecasting has the potential to support a broad scope of applications, ranging from urban planning to housing market recommendations.},

A number of studies, therefore, have been devoted to quantifying the impacts of air pollution on property value in China. However, the empirical results are somewhat mixed. This naturally raises questions of whether there is a significant relationship between air quality and housing prices and the plausible reasons for the mixed results in previous studies. This study aims to fill this gap by explaining the variations in the findings by a meta-regression analysis. To control for heterogeneity, a weighted least square model was used to explore the factors influencing the magnitude and significance of the air quality effect based on empirical estimates from 117 observations. This study confirms that air quality does have a discernible impact on housing prices beyond the publication bias. Besides, the types of air quality indicator and the air data source do significantly influence estimates through affecting both the magnitude of the elasticity and the partial correlation coefficient (PCC). Further, the selections of control variables and estimation approaches also have significant impacts on estimates. This study also finds that published papers tend to be biased towards more economically significant estimates. The implications of the findings have also been discussed.},

A HOQM of M-MHEV is formulated to ascertain the weight coefficient of vehicle performance indicators according to different regional requirements and a parameter matching and optimization method for power system, employing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, is suggested to assess and harmony the vehicle's performance. Firstly, a house of quality model of M-MHEV is constructed to ascertain the weight coefficient of vehicle performance indicators derived from different regional demands. Additionally, a method is introduced for optimization of power system parameters of M-MHEV based on regional demand, the PSO algorithm is employed to optimize the characteristic parameters. And sensitivity analysis of characteristic parameters is conducted relying on user needs in different regions. The simulation results show that users in the northern and southern regions have different final weight coefficients for vehicle performance indicators and the parameters not only exert a substantial individual influence but also exhibit an interaction effect on the vehicle performance. Finally, a series of comparative simulations, are carried out with two optimization parameters respectively, the simulation outcomes demonstrate that the solution obtained through optimized design parameters solution could markedly enhance the technical parameters of the vehicle. The efficacy and viability of the proposed method based on user needs in different regions are verified.

The development of a machine learning model provides a good means of solving complex problems. This study aims to clarify the relationship between urban environmental variables and the urban thermal environment through high-precision machine learning models as well as provide scenarios of future urban thermal environment developments. We defined an urban thermal environment index (UTEI), considering twelve urban form and natural indicators sourced from the remote sensing data of 150 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region from 2000 to 2015. We achieved accurate predictions of UTEI through training a gradient-boosted regression trees model. By unpacking the model, we found that the contribution rate of elevation (ELEV) was the highest. Among all the urban form indicators, the elongation index (ELONG), urban population (POP), nighttime light intensity (NLI), urban area size (AREA), and urban shape index (SHAPE) also had high contributions. We set up five scenarios to simulate the possible impact of different urban form factors on the overall urban thermal environment quality in the region. Under extremely deteriorated patterns that do not control urban expansion and vegetation reduction, the average UTEI could be as high as 0.55--0.76 {$^\circ$}C in summer and 0.24--0.29 {$^\circ$}C in winter, yet in the extremely optimized situation, UTEI decreased by 0.69 {$^\circ$}C in summer and 0.56 {$^\circ$}C in winter. Results showed that better urban form improves the quality of urban environments and can provide important insights for urban planners to mitigate urban heat island problems. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Thermal comfort is a subjective experience in which the human body feels satisfied with the thermal environment. The human thermal sensation is mainly related to the heat balance of the whole body. This balance is not only affected by environmental parameters such as air temperature, average radiant temperature, wind speed and air humidity, but also by human activities and dress. Local thermal discomfort includes evaluation indexes such as draft, vertical temperature difference, ground heating and cooling, and radiation asymmetry. When these parameters are estimated or measured, the overall thermal sensation of the person can be predicted by calculating the predicted mean thermal sensation index (PMV). Internationally, the currently accepted standard for predicting and evaluating indoor thermal environment comfort is ISO 7730-2005 and American Standard ASHRAE 55-2013. In the ISO 7730-2005 standard, the comfort is evaluated for the steady-state and non-steady-state thermal environments. The evaluation of the steady-state environment mainly evaluates the PMV, PPD indicators and local thermal discomfort. The unsteady environment is mainly evaluated from indicators such as temperature cycle and drift. In terms of thermal comfort evaluation, after extensive experiments, the researchers tried to link the four elements that make up the thermal environment (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and ambient average radiant temperature) to the thermal sensation of the human body. However, heat balance is not a sufficient condition for human thermal comfort. The Fanger thermal comfort equation and its evaluation indicators have their limitations. Studies have shown that the actual thermal sensation of the test subjects is significantly higher than the PMV through the thermal comfort survey of winter and summer residential buildings, and pointed out that there is a lack of equations. To this end, this paper carried out a test for the thermal sensation characteristics of Chinese people, conducted thermal comfort tests on nine environmental conditions of refrigeration and heating through 40 subjects of different ages, and determined the differences in thermal sensory characteristics of human body at different ages, analyze the test results and correct the PMV equation according to the results to make it more in line with the physiological characteristics of Chinese people. The test results show that the thermal sensation index of children and the elderly is significantly different, the children's thermal sensation is obviously cold, while the elderly are obviously warm, and the thermal sensation characteristics of adults with different genders are also different. Men are more like cold than women. When testing for the elderly and children, gender has little effect on the characteristics of thermal sensation, and there is no obvious difference between hot and cold in different genders. {\copyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

However, there is a lack of city-scale UTCI mapping over urban agglomerations during heat waves, and of studies of the variation of UTCI-based urban heat island intensities across cities. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the relationships among UHI intensities calculated by different types of temperature. In this study of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), we conducted city-scale UTCI mapping during periods of heat waves, based largely on satellite data. We then compared the UHI intensities in three megacities (Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou) in terms of the UTCI, and distinguished the differences between UHI intensities based on different types of temperature. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) The UTCI varies considerably with land cover type, with values generally higher in urban areas. Although the spatial pattern of UTCI and air temperature appears similar, over urban surfaces the former indicator is significantly higher than the latter. (2) The areas affected by (very) strong thermal stress (quantified by the UTCI) expanded by 18},

  abstract = {Rapid urbanization is one of the most concerning issues in the 21st century because of its significant impacts on various fields, including agriculture, forestry, ecology, and climate. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high-and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect alters local thermal environment and affects thermal comfort of urban dwellers. However, the similarities and differences of the UHI when characterized by different thermal indicators (i.e., different types of temperatures and thermal comfort indices) remain poorly understood. Taking 30 major Chinese cities as an example, here we compared the spatiotemporal patterns and drivers of the UHI intensity (UHII) represented by six different thermal indicators, i.e., Ia (UHII represented by surface air temperature), Is (land surface temperature), Id (dew-point temperature), IHD (Humidex), Imrt (mean radiant temperature), and IUTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index). These thermal indicators encompass temperature factors that capture changes in the natural environment and thermal comfort indices that reflect the human perception of changes in ambient heat and humidity. The results show that the ranking of the annual mean UHII is similar between the day and night (i.e., Is {\textquestiondown} IUTCI {\textquestiondown} Imrt {\textquestiondown} Ia {\textquestiondown} IHD {\textquestiondown} Id). From a seasonal perspective, the daytime Is and Imrt exhibit the highest variability among all indicators, while the IUTCI demonstrates the largest difference among climate zones. Regarding the UHI drivers, most of the UHI indicators (except Id) are negatively correlated with the urban-rural difference in vegetation index during the day. At night, the UHI indicators are negatively related to the climatic variables and the urban-rural difference in albedo. Our results by using the IUTCI to assess outdoor thermal comfort across local climate zones (LCZs) show that the inter-LCZ standard deviation of the IUTCI is 1.94 {$^\circ$}C during the day and 2.16 {$^\circ$}C at night. We believe that these results deepen our understanding of the UHII when characterized by different thermal indicators, especially from the human perception perspective. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study examines human thermal comfort in different landscapes of an urban park in Chengdu and determines the thermal benchmarks. A machine learning (random forest) analysis shows that human thermal sensation is affected by different meteorological factors in different seasons. In addition, the influences of landscape space on human thermal comfort have considerable differences in different seasons. Residents prefer strong solar radiation in winter but fast wind speed in summer. UTCI (universal thermal climate index) is better than PET (physiological equivalent temperature) for outdoor thermal comfort assessment in the study area. This study serves as a valuable baseline and technical reference, contributing to sustainable urban park design.},

On the one hand, we test whether neighbourhoods with a good accessibility are more attractive and consequently show higher housing prices. For this purpose, we introduce an adapted Walk Score as part of the accessibility indicators. On the other hand, we compare an ordinary-least-squares regression (OLS) and a spatial lag model and test which model better explains residential housing prices. The regression models show the importance of classical factors such as dwelling characteristics or the types of neighbours. In addition, they also reveal that a differentiated approach is needed for analysing the accessibility, the location and the environment of a dwelling. The mere presence of a single amenity, a public transport stop or a motorway access is not a sufficient explanatory factor. Information such as density of supply, walking distances or public transport service quality needs to be taken into account as well as. The test of the spatial lag model reveals that prices of the most proximate dwellings can be taken into account as a relevant factor in explaining residential housing prices and should therefore be included in research on residential housing prices. {\copyright} 2019 The Author(s).

Hence, it is important to evaluate such risks in association with the variation found in environmental parameters. With this in mind, this research aimed to investigate the possible thermal risks present in bike paths, which are important urban spaces by using thermal comfort indicators. The research was conducted in Balneario Camboriu, Santa Catarina state (SC), Brazil, in summertime, and sought to evaluate the proportion of bike paths that were affected by uncomfortable thermal conditions. The study employed Sky View Factor (SVF) and Local Climate Zone (LCZ), two physical indicators of urban areas, to choose the most thermally comfortable bike paths. The estimation of thermally comfortable conditions was conducted in two time points: early morning (9:00 AM) and late afternoon (4:00 PM). The findings showed that most of the studied bike paths were thermally uncomfortable early in the morning. However, in the late afternoon the level of thermal discomfort tended to gradually drop. Moreover, the analysis revealed that two key factors influencing the estimations of thermal comfort were the LCZ and the specific type of thermal comfort index employed in the study. The research findings provide a base for the development of thermally adaptive strategies directed at creating sustainable outdoor spaces that are conducive to activities such as cycling. These measures can potentially assist urban planning and design practices to enhance thermal comfort in outdoor environments, reducing thermal risks and thereby promoting more sustainable and inclusive outdoor activities.},

In order to evaluate the thermal comfort of Shenzhen in 2020, the hourly data of 65 weather stations covering 11 LCZ types are used to calculate UTCI, which is used to analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of thermal comfort and related factors. The results show that the thermal comfort of 11 types of LCZ in Shenzhen all year round conforms to the characteristics of Shenzhen's subtropical monsoon climate. The 11 types of LCZ thermal comfort are higher at night than during the day. The thermal comfort of different LCZ types is statistically significantly different. The ``Built type'' LCZ has a higher thermal comfort value than the ``Land cover type'' LCZ, and the time in the thermal level is longer. Summer thermal comfort in Shenzhen was found to be positively correlated with building surface fraction, building height, street aspect ratio, and distance to the sea, and negatively correlated with sky view factor and pervious surface fraction. In addition, the summer sea breeze has a cooling effect on the thermal comfort of the entire Shenzhen area, and the barrier-free ventilation corridor can observe a better cooling effect.

Due to the limitations in available data and technologies, existing hedonic studies mainly capture accessibility to green space (i.e., proximity), and how visual contact with green space (i.e., visibility) impacts housing prices is not well understood. This paper measures the intangible concept of visual contact with green space by taking advantage of street view images and community photos based on semantic segmentation. Then, based on hedonic model theory, a set of housing price determinants is selected. Finally, we construct two models, namely, random forest regression and geographically weighted regression models, to explore the capitalization effects of visual contact with green space on housing prices in Shenzhen, China. In our study, compared with indicators such as park accessibility and greening rate, variables of green visual contact are more important for housing prices. Moreover, the effects of visual contact with green space inside and outside the community display marked spatial variations. This work is a beneficial attempt to focus on the human scale for the actual demand of urban green planning. The findings of this paper add further knowledge to highlight the importance of visual contact with green space in street design and urban planning, which can enrich research on the amenity values of green space and the quality of public space theoretically and methodologically.},

The tested drivers include urban agglomeration, physical indicators (e.g., vegetation and built-up indices), and socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population, gross domestic production, and nightlight intensity). The results show that physical indicators are determinants of daytime SUHIs whereas socioeconomic indicators are determinants of nighttime SUHIs, which indicates that daytime and nighttime SUHIs have different causal mechanisms in this region. Moreover, the results reveal that the influence of urban agglomeration on urban surface temperature is more significant at nighttime than in daytime, which implies that the warming effect of urban agglomeration is stronger at night. Together, the results indicate that joint control of urban size, urbanization level, and socioeconomic activities is crucial to alleviate SUHIs and safeguard sustainable development in this region. {\copyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

The land surface temperatures (LSTs) have gained considerable attention as a typical indicator for studying the urban thermal environment. Accounting for the deficiency of existing calculation methods in calculation principle of LSTs from the low-altitude thermal infrared remote (TIR) sensing data, this study proposes a method to retrieve the LSTs at a block scale with high temporal and spatial resolution for the effective evaluation of micro urban thermal environment. Thus, the thermal infrared radiation transmission equation is rewritten according to the actual thermal infrared transmission process. The final calculation form of LSTs is given, in which the multi-source data is employed. Ultimately, to verify the accuracy of this method in calculating the LSTs, an application case is designed. The results indicate that the temperature differences between the calculated LSTs and the measured LSTs ranges from -1.73 K to 1.45 K, and the absolute accuracy of the method is 0.09 K based on the correctly obtained multi-source data. This method is available for the quantitative analysis of the urban thermal environment and urban heat island effect at a block scale.},

The traditional station square design focuses on the transport system and lacks the co-regulation of landscape services (e.g., climate change, scale, and element configuration). Moreover, holistic optimal design strategies are still deficient. This study examines how thermal comfort is positively affected by various landscape layout patterns, the configuration ratio of deciduous to evergreen trees and vegetation structure. We selected a typical station square of the Hokuriku region as an example, measured a landscape microclimate environment in winter and summer during extremely cold and hot days. The thermal comfort performance, represented by the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal index, was compared using the ENVI-met simulation to reproduce the original case and new landscape design scenarios. The results indicated that planting trees in an array layout pattern with low PMV distributions improved thermal performance at 14:00 (0.3 PMV increase in winter and 1.3 PMV decrease in summer). The tree configuration ratio is a critical greening indicator that also regulates thermal comfort during the day and night. The finds of the research can be used optimized scenarios as a guide for urban station square design to mitigate thermal comfort issues and to promote the development of station square planning complying with climate-adaptive design strategies and the construction of sustainable cities. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This study focused on the long time series analysis of UHI during the period 2000-2018, and analyzed the impact of land cover type and landscape metric factors on surface temperature. The results revealed that the UHI had a continuously decreasing trend in 2005--2010, and an increasing trend in 2000--2005 and 2010--2018. Cropland, built-up land, patch density (PD), Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI), and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) had a positive relationship with UHI, whereas forestland, open water, and CONTAG had a negative correlation with the UHI effect. The Geodetector analysis further revealed that PD, SHDI, and LSI had the greatest influences on LST as the three factors had the largest q values (0.287, 0.286, and 0.278). Forestland, cropland, and built-up land had greater impacts on the UHI than other land cover type factors. The explanatory power reached a maximum value of 0.408 when built-up land and cropland variables interacted. The findings of this study provide new understandings of the relationship between urban landscape and UHI, as well as important insights for urban planners to mitigate the UHI effect for the sustainable development of future urban agglomeration.

  abstract = {China's rental housing market has just started to develop in recent years. It is relatively imperfect and lacks a clear reference for the pricing of rents, which is not fully transparent. A study on the rent formation mechanism of rental housing has policy implications for the construction of a guiding price for the rental housing market and the establishment of a reference basis for the pricing of subsidized housing. Referring to the definition of a benchmark land price, we use data from Beijing to innovatively introduce the concept of benchmark rent. Based on hedonic price theory and the driving factors of benchmark rent, a system of indicators is constructed to explore the mechanism of influencing factors at meso and micro levels on the benchmark rent of market-based rental housing. After LaGrange and robustness tests, it is found that the spatial error model (SEM) is more suitable for benchmark rent determination. We conclude that benchmark rents are affected by spatial relationships caused by spatial heterogeneity and dependency, and that there is significant spatial variation in the factors affecting market-based rental housing benchmark rents. The determination of the benchmark rent can be used as a guiding signal for the market, as a clear signal expectation for the market, government, and tenants. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.

Longitudinal and cross-sectional questionnaire surveys are carried out during the summer in public squares in Chongqing.

Taking Xi'an, a metropolis in northern China, as the case study, we first conducted a 3-year meteorological investigation, including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed in both summer and winter. Meanwhile, five indicators with potential impacts on urban climate were selected to describe the urban characteristics. Then, the geographic information system was applied to integrate the meteorological data and urban characteristic data in order to assign more meteorological data. Next, three types of meteorological single factor and thermal comfort spatial distribution maps were derived. The k-means clustering analysis method was then employed to classify three types of meteorological factors into seven zones in horizontal spatial dimension. Finally, urban climate maps were generated. This study can help planners quickly distinguish urban climate-sensitive and valuable zones in order to make better strategies for future development.},

  abstract = {Urban green spaces have many vital ecosystem services such as air cleaning, noise reduc-tion, and carbon sequestration. Amid these great benefits from urban green spaces, the cooling effects via shading and evapotranspiration can mitigate the urban heat island effect. The impact of urban green spaces (UGSs) on the urban thermal environment in Beijing was quantified as a case study of metacities using four metrics: Land surface temperature (LST), cooling intensity, cooling extent, and cooling lapse. Three hundred and sixteen urban green spaces were extracted within the 4th ring road of Beijing from SPOT 6 satellite imagery and retrieved LST from Landsat 8 remote sensing data. The results showed that the cooling intensity of green spaces was generally more prominent in the areas with denser human activities and higher LST in this metacity. Vegetation density is always the dominant driver for the cooling effect indicated by all of the metrics. Furthermore, the results showed that those dispersive green spaces smaller than 9 ha, which are closely linked to the health and well-being of citizens, can possess about 6{\textopenbullet} C of cooling effect variability, suggesting a great potential of managing the layout of small UGSs. In addition, the water nearby could be introduced to couple with the green and blue space for the promotion of cooling and enhancement of thermal comfort for tourists and residents. As the severe urban heating threatens human health and well-being in metacities, our findings may provide solutions for the mitigation of both the urban heat island and global climate warming of the UGS area customized cooling service. {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

The accurate characterization and quantification of UHI are crucial for sustainable urban development. Few UHI studies, however, compare data source, spatio-temporal variations, and indicators for the same city in parallel. This study uses Changchun, a snow climate city in China, as an example and compares five different indicators of the UHI based on land surface temperature (LST) derived from Landsat 8 TIRS and hourly air temperature (AT) collected from 41 meteorological weather stations to conduct a more comprehensive comparative study of the UHI. The results show the following. (1) The relationships between LST and AT are all statistically significant, and the surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity characterized by the LST is considerably stronger than that of AT both in summer and winter. (2) The SUHI intensity is significantly stronger in summer (6.83 {$^\circ$}C) than in winter (1.55 {$^\circ$}C) based on the morning LST, whereas the UHI intensity (0.27 {$^\circ$}C in summer and 0.40 {$^\circ$}C in winter) that is simultaneously quantified by the AT has an opposite result. The mean whole-day and daytime UHI intensity difference, which is quantified hourly by the AT between summer and winter, is not significant. The difference between nighttime and daytime UHI intensities is evident in both summer (1.26 {$^\circ$}C) and winter (0.76 {$^\circ$}C). Additionally, the high temperatures for both LST and AT have a more concentrated distribution in winter than in summer. (3) The values of UHI/SUHI intensity considerably vary based on different indicators. The different choices among land covers to represent ``urban'' and ``rural'' areas would significantly affect the values of UHI/SUHI intensity. The selection of appropriate indicators and data sources to quantify the UHI remains a problem that has to be resolved in future studies. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, most studies have ignored the temporal characteristics of urban vibrancy and only considered its spatial nature. This study optimizes the identification model of urban vibrancy centers and proposes a novel model for evaluating the time-dynamic accessibility of urban vibrancy centers. The model takes into account real-time changes in travel costs and analyses its spatial correlation with housing prices. The case study of Chengdu shows significant variations in the spatiotemporal distribution of urban vibrancy centers. High-vibrancy areas are concentrated near commercial complexes. The time distribution of urban vibrancy accessibility is more concentrated at night (18:00--24:00), and the high-accessibility areas are located around the old city and the newly planned Central Business District in the south. Housing prices and urban vibrancy centers accessibility are mainly negatively correlated spatially. The study emphasizes the temporal nature of urban vibrancy and accessibility and enriches the evaluation model of urban vibrancy centers. It also contributes to the improvement of the framework of urban vibrancy research and deepens the understanding of the important variable of ``time'' in urban planning. {\copyright} 2023 The Author(s).

Currently, SUHI FP extraction methods ignore the interference caused by the city shape and are mostly based on the isotropic expansion assumption, resulting in an exaggerated range. Therefore, a new approach for an optimization schema that leverages the assumptions of angle segmentation and anisotropy is proposed herein. This method divides an urban area and its buffer rings into 16 sectors with equal central angles and selects appropriate land surface temperature (LST) curves for an exponential decay fit. The final FP was determined using the SUHI extension distance and the reference rural LST. To verify the effectiveness of this method, SUHI FPs of 27 cities in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) were extracted during the summer of 2019, and the results were compared with those derived from traditional methods. The results showed that the FPs calculated using this method were more detailed because they minimized the influence of urban shape, topography, and the surrounding landscape. Moreover, this method played a vital role in revealing the effect of the land use allocation outside urban area on the SUHI effect. This state-of-the-art method is useful for unveiling SUHI spatial distribution patterns and for providing scientific support for land planning for sustainable urban development. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Correlations analysis between the daily maximum urban heat island intensity (UHIImax) and the meteorological variables indicates that it is inadequate to identify meteorological conditions conducive to UHI development using a single variable, such as solar radiation, cloud cover, or wind speed. The correlations between the daily UHIImax and the indicators are significant (r {\textquestiondown} 0.60, P {\textexclamdown} 0.001). The observations are split into calibration and validation sets. Then, the performances of the four methods are evaluated, and the appropriate thresholds for identifying meteorological conditions conducive to UHI development in Nanjing are determined. The results demonstrate that all four methods can be used for identifying meteorological conditions conducive to UHI development in Nanjing. The features and limitations of the four methods and the potential applications are discussed. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The SUHI intensity (SUHII) is a key indicator of SUHIs, and its estimation necessitates the acquisition of land surface temperature (LST) data for urban areas. However, in many previous studies, urban areas were simply defined as those with the proportion of impervious surfaces exceeding a certain threshold. Therefore, the delineated urban areas often included natural surfaces such as croplands and water bodies, leading to uncertainties in SUHI studies. In this study, the regressionmodification-estimation (RME) method was proposed to quantify the SUHII and analyze the relationships between the SUHII and its driving factors across 1031 global cities. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) the RME method mitigates the uncertainties associated with the definitions of urban and rural areas, providing accurate estimation of the impact of urbanization-induced land cover changes on the LST. (2) The annual daytime and nighttime average SUHII values for the 1031 cities derived from the RME method were 2.05 degrees C and 1.79 degrees C, respectively. The SUHII values derived from the RME method were 24.8},

This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 degrees C in 2009 to 4.04 degrees C in 2018. The highest and lowest summer daytime LST estimates were recorded over impervious surface area (ISA) and waters, respectively.},

The effects of landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment within a single area or single period have been well documented. Few studies, however, have explored whether the effects can be adapted to various cities at different urbanization stages. This paper investigated the variations of these effects in the five largest and highly urbanized megacities of China from 1990 to 2020 using various geospatial approaches, including concentric buffer analysis, correlation analysis, and hierarchical ridge regression models. The results indicated that the effects of landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment were greatly variable at different urbanization stages. Although landscape composition was more important than landscape configuration in determining the urban thermal environment, the standard coefficients of composition metrics continuously decreased from 1990 to 2020. However, configuration metrics, such as patch density, edge density, and shape com-plexity, could affect the land surface temperature (LST) to a larger extent at the highly urbanized stage. The urbanization process could also affect the cooling effect of urban green space. At the initial stage of rapid urban expansion in approximately 2000, urban green space explained the most variation in LST, with a value as high as 10},

Especially in cities where vulnerability to heatwaves is high, it is necessary to detect the most appropriate indicators for the regional characteristics and action planning with respect to thermal comfort. The aim of the study is to examine thermal indices as indicators of regional climate characteristics by relating to meteorological parameters and spatial features. Atmospheric variables including air temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and relative humidity data were obtained from 30 meteorological stations located in districts having different climatic features. Heat stress levels for apparent temperature (AT), heat index (HI), wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), physiological equivalent temperature (PET), universal thermal climate index (UTCI), and perceived temperature (PT) indices were calculated and associated with meteorological parameters. Thermal comfort maps have been created with the daily mean and maximum values of all indices. As a result, the meteorological parameters with the strongest correlation with all thermal indices are air temperature (Ta) with r = 0.89 {\textpm} 0.01 and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) with r = 0.75 {\textpm} 0.16. The differences in thermal stress levels over the city have been distinctively observed in the ATmax, PETmax, and PTmax maps, which are generated by the daily maximum values of the indices. {\c C}atalca, where forests cover large areas compared to highly urbanized districts, has the lowest heat stress defined by all indices. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

However, the distribution of green spaces in urban areas is often uneven, leading to issues such as ``green inequity.'' This study aims to systematically assess the level of green space exposure at overhead and eye levels, analyze the geographical and social equity of green space exposure, and propose planning and regulatory strategies. Focusing on Nanjing as the study area, the research team first constructed a green space exposure assessment system based on the composition and configuration of urban green spaces at the overhead level, and the quantity and perceived quality of street green space at the eye level, assessing the geographical equity of green space exposure. Next, by selecting housing price as a socioeconomic indicator, the research used various spatial regression models to analyze the spatial correlation between green space exposure and housing price, evaluating the social equity of green space exposure. The research finds 1) significant imbalances in both the geographical and social equity of green space exposure within the study area; 2) the spatial correlation between eye-level green space exposure indicators and housing price ranges from 0.08 to 0.29, generally higher than that at overhead level (ranging from 0.02 to 0.13); 3) significant heterogeneity in the spatial correlation between green space exposure and housing price, with people in higher-priced housing being more likely to benefit from green space services. The results can accurately identify blind spots in green space exposure and imbalance areas between green space supply and socioeconomic status, providing guidance for ``scientific greening,'' and further promoting empirical studies in Exposure Ecology. {\copyright} Higher Education Press 2025.},

Although nighttime LST is an essential indicator in urban thermal research, few LST downscaling studies have focused on nighttime in fine resolution. This study proposed a novel approach using local linear forest (LLF) to downscale 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nighttime LSTs to 250 m spatial resolution in three cities: Rome, Madrid, and Seoul. First, we used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select a set of past clear-sky ASTER LSTs (ALST) which showed a high spatial correlation with the target MODIS LST. Downscaling models were then developed using input kernels of the selected ALSTs and eight auxiliary variables: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope, built-up area percentage, road density, population density, wind speed, and distance from the built-up weighted center of the study area. Three schemes were evaluated: scheme 1 (S1) using only auxiliary variables as input kernels with a random forest (RF) model; scheme 2 (S2) using selected ALSTs and auxiliary variables as input kernels with an RF model; and scheme 3 (S3) using input kernels as in S2 but with the LLF model. Validation was performed using bias-corrected ALSTs for seven reference dates in the three cities. LLF-based S3 showed the highest accuracy with an average correlation coefficient (R) {$\sim$} 0.94 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) {$\sim$} 0.64 K while maintaining the dynamic range of the original LST at the finer resolution. The downscaled LST (DLST) based on S3 effectively depicted the nocturnal thermal spatial pattern in greater detail than the other two schemes did. The S3-based DLST also showed a relatively high spatial correlation with the in-situ nighttime air temperature within the cities. When compared to the original 1 km LST, S3-based DLST showed larger surface urban heat island intensity for the urban-type surfaces and a higher temporal correlation with nighttime air temperature. {\copyright} 2022 The Authors},

  abstract = {As a basic natural and strategic resource, water is of great significance to the sustainable development of economies and societies. Owing to population growth, industrialization, the acceleration of urbanization, and global warming, water poverty is gradually increasing in some parts of the world. Effectively assessing water poverty from different dimensions is still a serious challenge for global water resources planning. This paper establishes a framework of multidimensional water poverty (MWP) from six dimensions: water management, water technology, water assets, water welfare, water resources, and water environment. The measurement model of MWP is built based on the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and the Spatial Correlation Analysis tool is used to visualize the spatial effects of MWP. The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) was used as a case study and the main factors affecting the MWP of the YREB were determined by the Geodetector. When analyzing the results the following observations were made: (1) In terms of time distribution, the level of MWP in the YREB has gradually increased, and the poverty gap between the upper reaches, as well as the middle and lower reaches, shows an increasing trend. (2) With respect to spatial distribution, there is a continuously increasing agglom-eration effect that shows a gradient-increasing distribution pattern of "West-Central-East." (3) The MWP in the YREB is mainly affected by these indicators in the three dimensions consisting of water resources, water tech-nology, and water management. Specifically, R\&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP, the proportion of water -saving irrigation area in the cultivable land area, the urban daily wastewater treatment capacity, the land surface water resources per capita, and the groundwater resources per capita play an important role in the MWP. Based on the above findings, targeted policy recommendations are proposed to alleviate the MWP in the YREB.}

  abstract = {To elucidate the differences in thermal perceptions between urban and rural residents in outdoor open spaces, we determined factors influencing outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) of urban and rural residents in Xi'an, China by meteorological measures and questionnaires. Physiological equivalent temperature (PET) was used to determine thermal benchmarks. Factors (i.e., physical, social, individual and psychological) that influenced urban and rural residents' thermal perceptions were analyzed and compared. We found that: 1) The neutral PET (NPET) and preferred PET of rural residents (NPET: 18.83 {$^\circ$}C; preferred PET: 27.6 {$^\circ$}C) were both higher than those of urban residents (NPET: 16.82 {$^\circ$}C; preferred PET: 22.1 {$^\circ$}C). The lower limit of the neutral PET range (NPETR) and the thermal acceptable range (TAR) for rural residents (NPETR: 8.97--28.70 {$^\circ$}C; TAR: -2.48--36.33 {$^\circ$}C) were both lower than these of urban residents (NPETR: 9.28--24.36 {$^\circ$}C; TAR: -1.75--34.58 {$^\circ$}C), and the upper limit was both higher than these of urban residents. 2) In winter and summer, urban and rural residents were mainly influenced by physical factors. In spring, individual and psychological factors were primary influencers of urban residents' thermal perceptions, while rural residents were mainly influenced by physical factors. 3) A mathematical model comparing thermal sensation and environmental factors was built using multiple linear regressions, proportions of influences of different factors were determined, and the models performed well. Our results could provide a theoretical basis for determining thermal benchmarks between urban and rural residents, and provide technical guidance for designs of urban and rural open spaces concerning thermal comfort. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

X., \& Zhou, L.-A. (2015). Demystifying the Chinese housing boom. NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2015, Volume 30. University of Chicago Press.). We find that in the long-run, average housing prices react positively to inflation, money supply and bank lending growth, and negatively to the reserve requirement ratio and benchmark lending rate. Housing prices in Tier 1 cities respond more sensitively to monetary shocks relative to Tier 2 and 3 cities, possibly due to surging demand and limited supply under housing-purchase restrictions (HPR). We further study the volatility effect of monetary shocks using the GARCH model and find that the benchmark lending rate, reserve requirement ratio and money supply growth have strong negative impact on the volatility of housing price growth. Our benchmark results remain robust after incorporating the HPR policy variable in the estimation, with a significant negative effect of HPR on housing price growth in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Lastly, we conclude with recommendations on future monetary policy design and implementation, with a specific focus on the heterogeneous characteristics of China's housing market. {\copyright} 2019, {\copyright} 2019 Korea International Economic Association.},

Objectives: This study quantitatively analyzed the relationship between the 3D spatial pattern of buildings and UHI in China's 30 provincial capitals/municipalities and discussed them at grid-cell scale and city scale, respectively. Methods: In consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of the urban environment, Geographically Weighted Regression Model (GWR) was selected to identify the effects of 3D building landscape pattern on summer UHI among 30 megacities of China at both micro grid-cell scale and macro city scale. Nine landscape metrics that used to describe the 3D structure of buildings and the UHI that calculated by hot-spot analysis were collected as input variables. Results: The floor area ratio (FAR), the average height (AH), and the space congestion degree (SCD) are the most influential factors affecting UHI. AH and SCD are negatively correlated with UHI, while FAR is the opposite. However, these relationships are not static, and they will change when interfered with other factors. The relationship between FAR and UHI becomes negative in the case of relatively low FAR value. In areas with low building coverage ratio, AH is positively correlated with UHI. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed the complicated association between the 3D building spatial pattern and UHI at micro and macro urban contexts, which was significant for decision-makers to formulate policies based on local conditions. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In this article, four running events held in nearby popular travel spots in Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan, were selected to analyze the influence of thermal environment and air quality on thermal comfort. Mostly real time environmental monitoring data were applied for estimating thermal indicators, along with Sky View Factor (SVF) data taken at the sites of the running scheduled routes, to analyze the thermal performance of participants at running events. Compared with runners, walkers (local residents, fans, and staff of the events) would be exposed to a greater risk of thermal discomfort with increasing time spent on the routes. With the integrated analysis, mPET (modified physiologically equivalent temperature) can be viewed as a relatively comprehensive indicator in considering both environmental thermal conditions and the biometrical differences of activities and clothing types. From the results, a good correlation between mPET and solar radiation/SVF was obtained, which indicated that mPET could be sufficiently sensible in revealing the thermal condition variation from one site to another during the route with time. Based on the discomfort risk assessment, for runners, the event held in autumn with lower SVF at the route sites would be less risky of thermal discomfort, while the event held in spring with lower solar radiation would be more comfortable for walkers. As for air quality condition, the inappropriateness of holding winter outdoor activities in Kaohsiung was obviously shown in both real time monitoring data and long term analysis. {\copyright} 2020 by the authors.

The study examines the theory and practice of providing housing for citizens in Ukraine. The concepts of "free", "social" and "affordable" housing are studied and the practice of mechanisms of their formation in European countries is given. The legislative base of formation of social and affordable housing in Ukraine is briefly described. The general level of demand for housing in our state is outlined. To study the level of housing affordability for the population of our country, the authors used the adapted UN HABITAT methodology, taking into account the Ukrainian realities. We have taken as a basis a young family with two working people with average incomes for the region minus expenses at the subsistence level. At the same time such a young family have mostly one or two children and the priority of their purchase will be a small one-two-room apartment (or a two-bedroom apartment with a modern approach to construction) with an area of 43 sq.m. The results of the assessment of housing affordability obtained in this way show a general tendency to increase in the housing affordability index in Ukraine. At the same time, the real indicators of affordability are still quite low and characterize a fairly long period of cash savings of the population to obtain housing. The average value of affordability is 9.2 years in 2019, which is almost 6 times higher than the indicators of 2007. The value of affordability in the state varies considerably. It is found that the cities of Kyiv, Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv and Sumy regions have the highest affordability indicators. The lowest values are typical for the Western region of the state, in particular Zakarpattia, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Lviv, Rivne and Volyn regions. They are in the range of 11.5-16 years, which is almost 4 times different from the best indicators. The connection between housing affordability and the volume of construction and its commissioning and GDP growth rates is estimated. The state of mortgage lending in the state is analyzed. It has been found that there are currently more than 20 programs to support citizens in purchasing housing in Ukraine, but the effectiveness of most such programs is questionable and requires state support. Ways to implement an effective housing policy and its main components are proposed.},

The research method is descriptive-analytical and prescriptive with its scope being the 22 districts of Tehran in 2016. The TOPSIS model, Coefficient of Variation (CV), Moran's spatial autocorrelation, and Gi statistic (hot-spot analysis) have been used to analyze the data. Data were collected using library and documentary methods. The findings indicate that the 22 districts of Tehran have heterogeneity and divergence in terms of the selected residential quality indicators. This paper found a significant relationship between the quality of residence and social classes in Tehran. Throughout its development, the social classes of Tehran have become more distinct and its rich and poor districts -- in the north, center and south of the metropolis -- have separated more vividly. To solve the detrimental spatial inequality of Tehran and achieve sustainable development, the paper suggests the importance of applying the true nature of urban planning, especially in terms of residential planning primarily in the parts of the metropolis that inequality is predominantly observed. {\copyright} 2023 (Moslem Zarghamfard, Behnaz Bahadori, Robab Hoseinzadeh and Esmaiel Safaralizadeh)},

This study aims to address this issue by creating a comprehensive indicator system for the urban built-up environment, drawing from previous research. By employing multi-source data and diverse geospatial processing methods, this article examine the influence of 20 environmental factors on the spatial and temporal variability of SUHI in Shanghai during the summer and winter seasons from 2016 to 2020. This article findings reveal four key observations. (1) The average SUHI intensity in Shanghai's main urban area during the summers of 2016--2020 showed an increasing trend, with the heat island's shape and location differing between seasons. (2) The correlation values (R-values) between the built and road environment indicators and SUHI changed with season and year, reflecting the dynamic interplay among urban morphology, weather conditions, and human activities that affect heat generation and dissipation. (3) This article found that the increasing SUHI trend was not solely dependent on changes in individual built-up environment parameters. (4) This article analysis demonstrated that the built environment factor significantly influenced heat island intensity in summer, while the green space environment factor had a substantial impact during winter. In conclusion, the results emphasize the complex relationship between the urban built-up environment and SUHI, highlighting the need to consider various environmental factors when assessing their impact on SUHI formation. This study offers valuable insights to inform the development of effective strategies for mitigating the negative effects of SUHI on urban environments and promoting sustainable urban development. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Urban green space (UGS) is crucial for both urban nature and human beings, and numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of UGS in lessening the effects of the urban heat island (UHI). The possible connection between the equitable distribution of UGS across pixels and UHI, however, has primarily gone unnoticed. To ascertain the potential influence, this work utilizes the land surface temperature (LST) and the equitable distribution of UGS across pixels as indicators of UHI and UGS spatial distribution in Beijing, China, from 2000 to 2018 years, respectively. Specifically, the study generates a comprehensive UGS distribution map using UGS coverage fraction data and calculates the Gini coefficient to determine the grid-scale equitable distribution of UGS. The study also derives an LST map using Landsat data, surface emissivity, and atmospheric data through the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) algorithm. Finally, the indicator system of UGS and LST is established, including spatial distribution and grid-scale inequity for UGS, spatial distribution, and grid-scale statistical indicators (mean and median) for LST. Based on the proposed indicator system, a spatial-temporal analytical method is presented to reveal spatial-temporal patterns in the effect of UGS on urban LST. The results of our study show that: (1) total coverage and equity of UGS significantly increase, and UGS in Beijing is extremely unbalanced; (2) LST has increased rapidly in recent years, and the proportions of areas with increased temperature have developed; and (3) expanding UGS and ensuring an equitable distribution of UGS can lower urban LST. {\copyright} 2023 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach The broader list of indicators (which were identified through a thorough review of the literature) was assessed by water-related industry professionals and experts who were asked to assess the compliance of suggested indicators to five criteria of sustainability using a Likert scale. Findings It was found that the highest-ranked indicators across all five categories were mainly related to the chemical and physical quality of water, followed by availability of individual water meters as well as water supply tariffs' adjustment to users' income, and issues of ageing infrastructure. The lowest-ranked indicators among all categories were mainly related to investments into research and development, water management and awareness, feedback systems and flexibility. The least ranked indicators are seen to be more related to the scenarios when basic needs are covered and the stakeholders have extra time and resources for advancing the levels of water infrastructure sustainability. Practical implications The ranked and categorized indicators can be used as a powerful decision-making tool to improve the sustainability of the water system of Nur-Sultan or any other city in a developing country. Originality/value By conducting this study, it was aimed to address the aforementioned gap in the field in terms of running a wider scope assessment of indicators rather than looking at conventional environmental and socio-economic aspects. This provides novelty to the study, especially in the context of developing countries that need more guidance in terms of sustainable development of the water-related infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Urban green space takes a dominant role in alleviating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Most investigations into the effects of cooling factors from urban green spaces on the UHI have evaluated the correlation between each factor and land surface temperature (LST) separately, and the contribution weights of various typical cooling factors in mitigating the thermal environment have rarely been analyzed. For this research, three periods of Landsat 8 data captured between 2014 and 2018 of Xuzhou during the summer and autumn seasons were selected along with corresponding meteorological and flux measurements. The mono-window method was employed to retrieve LST. Based on the characteristics of the vegetation and spatial features of the green space, eight factors related to green space were selected and computed, consisting of three indices that measure vegetation and five metrics that evaluate landscape patterns: vegetation density (VD), evapotranspiration (ET), green space shading degree (GSSD), patch area ratio (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), patch natural connectivity (COHESION), patch aggregation (AI), and patch mean shape index distribution (SHPAE\_MN). Linear regression and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analyses between each green space factor and LST showed that there were significant negative linear and spatial correlations between all factors and LST, which proved that the eight factors were all cooling factors. In addition, LST was strongly correlated with all factors ({\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textquestiondown} 0.5) except for SHPAE\_MN, which was moderately correlated (0.3 {\textexclamdown} {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textexclamdown} 0.5). Based on this, two principal components were extracted by applying principal component analysis with all standardized green space factors as the original variables. To determine the contribution weight of each green space factor in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect, we multiplied the influence coefficient matrix of the initial variables with the standardized multiple linear regression coefficients between the two principal component variables and LST. The final results indicated that the vegetation indices of green space contribute more to the alleviation of the UHI than its landscape pattern metrics, and the contribution weights are ranked as VD {$\geq$} ET {\textquestiondown} GSSD {\textquestiondown} PLAND {$\approx$} LPI {\textquestiondown} COHESION {\textquestiondown} AI {\textquestiondown} SHAPE\_MN. Our study suggests that increasing vegetation density is preferred in urban planning to mitigate urban thermal environment, and increasing broadleaf forests with high evapotranspiration and shade levels in urban greening is also an effective way to reduce ambient temperature. For urban green space planning, a priority is to multiply the regional green space proportion or the area of largest patches. Second, improving the connectivity or aggregation among patches of green space can enhance their ability to cool the surrounding environment. Altering the green space spatial shape is likely the least significant factor to consider. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {With increased global warming, heatwaves are expected to become more intense, frequent, and persistent. Although the spatiotemporal characteristics of heatwaves have been extensively studied, the vast majority of these studies have solely used near-surface air temperatures, particularly daily maximum temperatures (Tmax), to identify heatwaves. Given that air temperature alone proves inadequate as a metric for human heat stress. Here, using the relative threshold in conjunction with the absolute threshold and basing it on wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), we develop a novel definition of human-perceived heatwaves. The combined effect of temperature and humidity is considered in this definition. On this basis, we quantify the climatology of and long-term changes in heatwaves in China based on homogenized in situ observations and outputs from climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The results show that the distribution of human-perceived heatwaves coincides with densely populated areas in the southeastern part of China, despite their limited spatial extent. The observed trends in human-perceived heatwaves have accelerated since the 1960s. It is now anticipated that moderate or worse human-perceived heatwaves will affect more than half of China's population. Moreover, CMIP6 climate projections suggest that the percentage of China's population exposed to historically unprecedented human-perceived heatwaves would increase rapidly in a warmer future, except for the sustainability scenario. It is noted that the increase in severe human-perceived heatwaves is more rapid than that in severe traditional Tmax-based heatwaves, suggesting that the hazard of heatwaves to humans may have been underestimated by previous Tmax-based studies. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for additional planning and adaptation actions beyond the framework for short-term disaster reduction frameworks currently in place. Although we concentrated on China in this article, our method for evaluating human-perceived heatwaves is easily extended to handle comparable issues everywhere. {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

Spatial patterns of urban LST are affected by urban landscape pattern changes and seasonal variations. Instead of using LST change data, this study analysed the variation of LST aggregation which was evaluated by hotspot analysis to measure the spatial dependence for each LST pixel, indicating the relative magnitudes of the LST values in the neighbourhood of the LST pixel and the area proportion of the hotspot area to gain new insights into the thermal effects of increasing impervious surface area (ISA) caused by urbanization in Fuzhou, China. The spatio-temporal relationship between urban landscape patterns, hotspot locations reflecting urban land cover change in space and the thermal environment were analysed in different sectors. The linear spectral unmixing method of fully constrained least squares (FCLS) was used to unmix the bi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI imagery to derive subpixel ISA and the accuracy of the percent ISA was assessed. Then, a minimum change threshold was chosen to remove random noise, and the change of ISA between 2000 and 2016 was analysed. The urban area was divided into three circular consecutive urban zones in the cardinal directions from the city centre and each circular zone was further divided into eight segments; thus, a total of 24 spatial sectors were derived. The LST aggregation was analysed in different directions and urban segments and hotspot density was further calculated based on area proportion of hotspot areas in each sector. Finally, variations of mean normalized LST (NLST), area proportion of ISA, area proportion of ISA with high LST, and area proportion of hotspot area were quantified for all sectors for 2000 and 2016. The four levels of hotspot density were classified for all urban sectors by proportional ranges of 0},

To investigate the correlation between thermal condition and urban spatial configuration, 24 typical scenarios were extracted from complex urban area, and 17 2D/3D indicators were selected to represent urban morphology characteristics. Different statistical approaches were employed to quantify the relationship between the selected indicators and MRT/PET. The results showed: (1) urban morphology exerted more influences on local thermal condition during daytime than at night, leading to the spatial heterogeneity of MRT/PET being much higher in the daytime; (2) the correlations between urban morphology indicators and MRT/PET changed dramatically when using different statistical approaches. This finding highlights the necessity of controlling the effect of building floor area ratio when quantifying the impacts of urban spatial configuration on local thermal comfort; (3) 3D urban morphology indicators were more significantly correlated with local thermal comfort than 2D indicators. Specifically, building floor area ratio and tree canopy coverage ratio were the most important predictor of MRT/PET during daytime and at night respectively. This study could further strengthen our understanding the effects of urban morphology on UHI. It could also offer useful insights to urban planners and decision makers on designing and constructing climateadaptive urban environment.},

While previous studies have explored green-space-triggered gentrification in individual cities, few have examined heterogeneities across multiple cities, especially in developing countries where cities are at different stages of expansion. The roles of green space in different stages of urbanization can produce varying outcomes of gentrification. This study investigated the relationship between green space and gentrification in Chinese cities from 2012 to 2020. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to adjacent parks, and area of adjacent parks were used as indicators of green space, while nighttime lights and residential land prices were used as proxies for gentrification. Nationwide analyses indicated that both increasing NDVI and building new parks nearby could lead to gentrification, but the park area had a marginal effect. Stratified analyses further showed that the effect of green space on gentrification was related to the different roles of green space associated with the stage of urbanization. Cities with higher urbanization rates were more affected by NDVI but less affected by park distance. Our findings provide insights for urban planners and decision-makers on developing localized strategies that mitigate the varying outcomes of gentrification at different stages of urban development. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

  abstract = {Changes in the thermal comfort condition of the living environment of human beings are one of the main concerns related to global warming. While previous studies largely focused on mean temperature and warm/cold extremes, changes in thermal comfort conditions (both comfort and discomfort conditions) have not been adequately revealed. Based on climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), future thermal comfort conditions over global land using net effective temperature index that considers the aggregate effects of temperature, relative humidity, and wind on human thermal perception were investigated. The focus was on the projected changes in thermal comfort conditions in different regions based on gross domestic product per capita, an indicator of adaptive capacity. An inequitable impact of escalating global warming on thermal comfort conditions emerges: in high-income regions (mostly distributed in cool mid-high latitudes), a diminishing number of cold-uncomfortable days and an increasing number of comfort days collectively would contribute to an improvement in thermal comfort conditions; however, in low-income regions (mostly distributed in warmer low latitudes), thermal comfort conditions are expected to worsen as a result of a dramatic increase in the number of warm-uncomfortable days that greatly exceeds the decrease in the number of cold-uncomfortable days and a decrease in the number of comfortable days. Moreover, analysis accounting for population exposure suggests that the overall impact of future changes in thermal comfort conditions on the global population is negative. Therefore, prioritized support for climate mitigation and adaptation to developing nations is justified and urgently needed. {\copyright} 2023 The Authors.

Namely, outdoor heat and comfort are of great significance to improve activity quality. Here, four unique outdoor spaces were studied to explore the varying effects on human thermal comfort during hot-summer and cold-winter periods. Distinct outdoor spaces (fully open, semi-open, semi-enclosed, and fully enclosed areas) from the southern campus of Anhui Jianzhu University were chosen. The PET was used as a metric for measuring thermal comfort and analyzing correlated spatiotemporal distributions. The results showed that outdoor thermal comfort was derived from multiple factors, including vegetation, underlying surface materials, building presence, and wind-heat environment. Notably, high correlations between Tmrt and thermal comfort were revealed, where such temperatures of places with trees or building shade were low; thus, PET was low. Further, Ws showed a significantly negative correlation with PET. Of the four outdoor space forms, the fully enclosed location had the lowest thermal comfort level, while the semi-enclosed spaces showed the highest level of body comfort. Therefore, semi-enclosed space (U-shaped) is recommended in campus planning and construction. Accordingly, an improved strategy was proposed based on experimental transformation for fully enclosed spaces. The thermal comfort after optimization was simulated to provide references for outdoor space thermal comfort improvement during seasonal extremes. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

In the existing studies, there is a lack of thermal comfort comparison between hot spots and cold spots. In this study, we selected the coastal city of Dalian in China as our study area and conducted field investigations on the thermal comfort of two landmark resorts, namely, a downtown commercial street and coastal leisure park. The study was conducted on typical summer days and consisted of interviewing several residents to understand their thermal comfort requirements. We investigated the thermal expectations of the interviewees through meteorological measurements and questionnaires. The universal thermal climate index (UTCI) was used to determine the thermal benchmarks of the on-site subjects. The results indicated that (1) globe temperature and air temperature were the most important factors that affected thermal comfort, followed by relative humidity and wind speed in summer daytime. (2) Shaded spaces are more comfortable than open spaces, and tree shade is preferred over artificial shade in coastal park. (3) The neutral UTCI (NUTCI) of the respondents were 24.1 degrees C (coastal park) and 26.0 degrees C (commercial street); the neutral UTCI ranges (NUTCIR) were 20.8-27.4 degrees C (coastal park) and 23.3-28.7 degrees C (commercial street). (4) The upper thermal acceptable range limits of the coastal park and commercial street were 30.2 and 32.1 degrees C, respectively, which were substantially higher than the upper NUTCIR limit, indicating that the residents in Dalian were well-adapted to hot weather. The results can provide a good reference for determining ideal design strategies to optimize the thermal environment of urban outdoor recreation spaces in summers and improve the quality of life in coastal cities.},

However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average {\textbar}Moran's I{\textbar} {\textexclamdown} 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high--high and low--high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran's I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran's I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces. {\copyright} 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Heatwaves describe prolonged periods of excessive heat. The increasing trend in heatwave frequency, duration, and magnitude in a warmer future has been extensively investigated. However, the vast majority of traditional studies on heatwaves consider only the role of air temperature, which is inadequate as a metric for human heat stress. While reported worsening levels in heat stress with global warming are concerning, the changes in heatwaves may not be directly comparable to the temperature increase. The reliable information on future changes in human-perceived heatwaves is still fairly limited. Given this context, we quantified future changes in human-perceived heatwaves in eastern China, where the population is dense and the summers are often sultry, based on dynamic downscaling climate projections and a human thermal comfort index that combines the effect of temperature and humidity. We demonstrated that under the 3.0 {$^\circ$}C of global warming (similar to late-century warming projected based on current mitigation policies), the frequency, duration, and magnitude of human-perceived heatwaves in eastern China would increase approximately 5, 4, and 20 times, respectively, relative to the reference period (1986--2005). Human-perceived heatwaves are projected to increase more rapidly than heatwaves solely based on the temperature definition, implying that the escalating heat risk for humans may have been underestimated by previous studies. Moreover, extra cautions need to be given to low-latitude regions, where the smallest changes in the mean temperature will probably be accompanied by the most pronounced increases in human-perceived heatwaves. Our results suggest the urgent demand of reducing greenhouse gas emissions toward mitigating persistent thermal discomfort in the future. Although here we focused on eastern China, our approach to assessing heatwaves can also be readily generalized to address similar problems worldwide. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

A regression analysis was utilized to investigate the effect of building morphology on outdoor thermal comfort, as well as its diversity across areas with varying characteristics. The connection and mechanism of action between building morphology and outdoor thermal comfort were investigated and elucidated. The findings reveal that building morphology have a substantial influence on the level of outdoor thermal comfort. Building surface coverage is the most critical indicator for predicting thermal comfort and heterogeneity in various scenarios. Additionally, it was noted that different building morphology indicators exhibit distinct correlations and varying degrees of correlation with the aforementioned elements. The impact of building morphology on outdoor thermal comfort is primarily attributed to its effect on solar radiation. The buildings classified as GG1 and GG5 demonstrate superior shading characteristics, resulting in optimal levels of outdoor thermal comfort. The primary objective of this study is to provide guidance for regulating outdoor thermal comfort from a building morphology viewpoint. {\copyright} 2024},

This study aims to address this gap by developing a set of valid and reliable performance indicators for assessing the social sustainability of urban regeneration initiatives in China's Historic Urban Areas (HUAs). Through an extensive literature review and a Delphi survey, critical social sustainability factors facilitating urban regeneration were identified. An assessment tool was subsequently proposed, comprising eight themes, 29 indicators, and a corresponding point-scoring system. Finally, Xi'an was selected as a case study to apply and test the applicability of the tool and to evaluate social sustainability performance to further explore improvement strategies. The results show that adequate housing, housing quality, participation in regeneration initiatives, and safe design were the most critical indicators determining the social sustainability of urban regeneration. Additionally, the results reveal indicators with limited contribution to achieving social sustainability in Xi'an.

  abstract = {Under the trend of rapid urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a hot issue for scholars to study. In order to better alleviate UHI effect, it is important to understand the effect of landuse/landcover (LULC) and landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment from perspective of landscape ecology. This research aims to quantitatively investigate the effect of LULC landscape patterns on UHI effects more accurately based on a landscape metrics analysis. In addition, we also explore the complex relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover. Taking Zhengzhou City of China as a case study, an integrated method which includes the geographic information system (GIS), remote-sensing (RS) technology, and landscape metrics was employed to facilitate the analysis. Landsat data (2000-2014) were applied to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of LST and LULC. The results indicated that the mean LST value increased by 2.32{$^\circ$}C between 2000 and 2014. The rise of LST was consistent with the trend of rapid urbanization in Zhengzhou City, which resulted in sharp increases in impervious surfaces (IS) and substantial losses of vegetation cover. Furthermore, the investigation of LST and vegetation cover demonstrated that fractional vegetation cover (FVC) had a stronger negative effect on LST than normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, LST was obviously correlated with LULC landscape patterns, and both landscape composition and spatial configuration affected UHI effects to varying degrees. This study not only illustrates a feasible way to investigate the relationship between LULC and urban thermal environment but also suggests some important measures to improve urban planning to reduce UHI effects for sustainable development. {\copyright} 2020 Hongbo Zhao et al.},

To analyze this effect, we conducted a series of experiments with thirty subjects of the Guangzhou University. The subjects were required to walk with and without masks in different conditions and were provided with questionnaires. The subjective votes and physiological indicators of the subjects were also recorded. Physiological equivalent temperature (PET) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI) were selected for thermal comfort evaluation. The results showed that wearing masks affected the breathing and thermal sensation of the subjects. As the walking speed increased, this effect became increasingly significant. The relationships between PET/UTCI and mean thermal sensation vote with and without masks, under three walking speeds were determined. The comfort zones corresponding to PET and UTCI were narrower and the neutral values were lower for subjects with masks compared to those without masks. The walking speed of pedestrians with masks in outdoor spaces during the interim season was suggested to not exceed the upper acceptable limit of 1.63 m/s.},

  abstract = {Mean radiation temperatures (MRTs) have gained widespread attention due to its close relationship with human health. Notwithstanding the availability of existing methods for evaluating MRT (such as ground-based measurements and numerical simulations), it remains a challenge to rapidly and accurately acquire MRTs with a high spatial resolution. This study thus proposed an efficient methodology for evaluating spatial MRTs of urban spaces on the microscale through multimodal images derived from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Based on UAVs and near-ground measurements, point-cloud data characterizing long- and short-wave irradiance from three-dimensional (3D) surfaces were obtained via photogrammetry and retrieval models. Spatial MRTs were then sampled based on a mapped 3D radiation field and ray-tracing. Comparison of the sampled MRTs with measured MRTs (near the ground) through globe temperatures exhibited a high consistency (R2: 0.980, RMSE: 3.080 {$^\circ$}C) and a small difference (almost less than 2.5 {$^\circ$}C), demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of our proposed method. In conjunction with near-ground meteorological variables, outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) indicators with a high spatial resolution were derived; further comparisons suggested the SET* and UTCI as ideal indicators to evaluate microscale OTC of hot and humid areas through our method. From the perspective of application, this method can further refine the assessment of the urban thermal environment as well as the human thermal comfort of micro-scale spaces based on simulations or remote sensing observations with lower spatial resolution, which will provide specific suggestions for redesign or redevelopment of the micro-scale areas. Additionally, the thermal mapping with high spatial resolution obtained by this method can also be used as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of related numerical models. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Three-dimensional (3D) landscapes have a great impact on urban thermal environments, while their heat conditions and driving factors still remain unclear. This study mapped urban 3D neighborhoods and their associated SUHI (surface urban heat island) intensities in summer daytime across 57 Chinese cities, and then explored their relationships, driving factors as well as implications. Nine categories of urban 3D neighborhoods existed in Chinese cities and the 3D neighborhood of High Density \& Medium Rise (HDMR) contributed the largest share of urban areas. The distribution of 3D neighborhoods varied among cities due to their distinct natural and economic traits. The average SUHI intensity can amount to 4.27 {$^\circ$}C across all Chinese 3D neighborhoods. High Density \& Low Rise (HDLR) and HDMR presented higher SUHI intensities than other 3D neighborhoods in China. Urban green space (UGI) and building height (BH) had great influences on SUHI intensities. The relative contribution of UGI decreased with the increase of building density and building height, but BH presented the opposite trend. The interaction of urban 3D landscapes and function zones led to highly complicated urban thermal environments, with higher SUHI intensities in industrial zones. Besides, the SUHI intensities of 3D neighborhoods presented great diurnal and seasonal variations, with higher SUHI intensities in HDHR and HDMR at nighttime in winter and summer. What's more, urban residents may suffer unequal heat risk inside cities due to the deviations of SUHI intensities among different 3D neighborhoods. It could be a highly effective way to mitigate SUHI effects in cities by increasing urban greening and improving urban ventilation. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Trees are utilized to adapt to urban heat; however, most tree planting is prioritized by either biophysical or social metrics, rather than an integration of the two. It therefore remains unclear how to maximize ecological and social benefits of tree planting in the context of environmental justice. Here, we analyze social vulnerability to heat and the cooling capacity of trees across 38 of the largest cities in the United States. We find that socially vulnerable people tend to live in hotter neighborhoods with less tree canopy. Furthermore, tree planting in such neighborhoods can achieve greater cooling benefits per unit increase in canopy. Increasing tree cover in these neighborhoods will meet the greatest need for cooling and achieve greater cooling capacity, creating social and ecological co-benefits. Adaptation measures must address both the distributional injustices of urban heat and procedural justice in planning and managing nature-based cooling approaches. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {In high-density urban areas, pocket parks offer significant potential to mitigate thermal discomfort. However, the specific contributions of horizontal and vertical canopy structures to pocket parks' cooling and thermal comfort effects remain unclear. This study addresses this gap by selecting 14 typical pocket parks in Shanghai and collecting high-resolution canopy and thermal data using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Generalized additive models were applied to assess the relationships between thermal conditions and spatial variables. The cooling effects were quantified by comparing the relative differences in surface temperature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta) between the pocket parks and non-vegetated reference sites, while thermal comfort was assessed using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The results revealed that: (1) On average, Ts was 3.98 {$^\circ$}C lower, Ta was 1.18 {$^\circ$}C lower, and UTCI was 3.74 {$^\circ$}C lower in pocket parks than in non-vegetated sites. (2) A positive linear relationship was found between {$\Delta$}UTCI and canopy coverage, indicating that increased canopy coverage enhances thermal comfort. (3) When considering three-dimensional (3D) metrics, mean foliage height was positively correlated with both {$\Delta$}Ta and {$\Delta$}UTCI, while foliage height diversity had a negative impact. Notably, the {$\Delta$}UTCI decreased when the 3D green volume exceeded 22 m3, suggesting that parks with tall, single-layer canopies composed of multiple small trees, each with a 3D green volume below 22 m3, optimize thermal benefits in summer. This study provides critical insights into the cooling and thermal comfort effects of pocket parks, offering practical guidance for park maintenance and redesign, particularly in the context of urban heat mitigation and adaptation strategies. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Water security is the backbone of regional development. However, it is generally compromised by the increasing competition for water resources between natural and social systems, especially in areas with limited water resources. Sustainable water planning requires a comprehensive analysis of supply and demand patterns, which is difficult owing to scale mismatches in data and methodologies. This study investigated the dynamics and interrelationships of water supply and demand in a semi-arid watershed of the Loess Plateau, China, by developing a system dynamics model that simulates water security during 1980--2020 and future changes under different climate, socioeconomic development, and inter-basin water diversion scenarios during 2021--2050. The results showed that (1) by the end of 2020, the regional water security level gradually approached the water scarcity threshold indicated by the water deficit index surpassing 0; (2) under unfavorable climate and progressive socioeconomic growth conditions, up to 16 out of 30 years of simulation demonstrated water insecurity in the form of a net water quantity deficit; and (3) the water diversion project can offset such deficits in the short term, but potentially aggravates water insecurity risk by eliciting a more rapid socioeconomic growth pattern. The results indicate that curbing demand and improving water-saving technology are instructive in water resource management. For the Yanhe Watershed, the quantity and pattern of water diversion should be improved in the future to guarantee water resource security on a full temporal scale. We suggest a moderate socioeconomic growth rate to be more appropriate for this region and that efforts to solidify water use redlines and advancement in water-saving technologies are essential in the future. This study provides a scientific basis for the long-term evaluation of regional water security on a full timescale with tightly coupled hydrological components and a modeling framework for decision-makers to manage water resources sustainably. {\copyright} 2023 The Authors}

  abstract = {The price of a house is affected by both the subjective and objective factors of the street environment in a neighborhood. However, the relationships between these factors and housing prices are not fully understood. Street view imagery (SVI) has recently emerged as a new data source for housing price studies. The SVI contains both objective and subjective information and can be used to extract objective measurements describing the physical environment and subjective measurements depicting human perceptions. Compared to conventional methods, there is consistency between subjective and objective information extracted from SVIs, and the two types of information are acquired from the perspective of the human visual perceptual system. Therefore, using both objective and subjective information extracted from street view images to study their relationship with housing prices has several advantages. In this study, focusing on the city of Suzhou, China, we extracted subjective perception and objective view indices from SVIs and systematically assessed their effects on housing prices. The global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and the local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model were used to model the correlations between these measures and housing prices. The OLS reveals that overall objective measures have stronger explanatory power, and built environment factors have a greater impact on housing prices. GWR shows that subjective factors can explain more variance in housing prices on the local scale and that home buyers care more about the subjective perceptions of the neighborhood's surroundings. The map of the GWR local coefficients demonstrates that the perception indicators have both positive and negative effects on housing prices in different places. In addition, a Monte Carlo test was performed to verify the spatially varying relationships between these measures. Our findings provide important references for urban designers and guide various applications, such as safe neighborhood design and sustainable city planning. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Research simultaneously examining building energy consumption and outdoor thermal comfort within urban environments remains limited. Few studies have delved into the sensitivity of design parameters based on building energy consumption and outdoor thermal comfort. The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlations between urban morphological design parameters and performance indicators, focusing on building energy consumption and outdoor thermal comfort (UTCI), across different urban block layouts in hot-humid regions, like Guangzhou. By establishing six fundamental morphological models---three individual unit layouts and three group layouts---the research explores both control and descriptive parameters through extensive simulation studies. Scatter plot visualizations provide insights into the impacts of various design parameters on energy consumption and UTCI, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of trends and quantitative relationships. Additionally, the study conducts sensitivity analyses on design parameters under different layout conditions to highlight their influences on target performance indicators. The findings reveal common trends, such as the significant impacts of plan dimensions and the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) on energy efficiency and outdoor comfort, as well as differential patterns, such as the varying sensitivities of the Shape Factor (S/V) and the Sky View Factor (SVF), across individual and collective layouts. Ultimately, this study offers a nuanced understanding of urban block morphology's role in creating sustainable, comfortable, and energy-efficient urban environments, providing valuable guidelines for urban form design in hot-humid climates. {\copyright} 2024 by the authors.},

  abstract = {In this study, a stepwise-clustered statistical downscaling model is established to simulate future apparent temperatures based on NCEP reanalysis data and four global climate models (GCMs). AP is a metric used to quantify thermal comfort or discomfort. The model can express nonlinear relationships between variables at large scale and local scale. The model is employed for projecting future apparent temperature changes over the Pearl River Delta (PRD), on the south coast of China, under three representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. The cluster tree generated for the daily apparent temperature is calibrated for the period 1971--1990 and validated for the period 1991--2000. The R2 values obtained for the validation period at eight selected cities for four GCMs (i.e., CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and IPSL-CM5A-LR) are 0.88, 0.87, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. The results reflected that apparent temperature is projected to have a constant increment over the PRD in the future period (2035--2095). Moreover, the monthly apparent temperature in April has the largest expected increment in the future period, while the smallest increment is found in January. The results also indicated that the apparent temperature increases faster than the air temperature under the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5 scenarios in the PRD. The findings illuminate that the expected increase in apparent temperature over the PRD can be mainly explained by increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds. The results can provide decision makers with useful information for urban health risk assessments. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Despite the relevance of urban water security in protecting water resources and supporting sustainable urban development, the literature seldom addresses sustainability and the features of urban water management practices in the assessment. Hence, based on the four sustainability dimensions (environment, society, economy and institution) and the cumulative objectives of urban water management transitions (from facilitating water supply, sewage, drainage, pollution treatment, water utilization, to resilience), this study analyzed the water security condition in Shanghai during 2011-2017 and examined the progress of the sequence of the Three-Year Action Plan on Environmental Protection and Construction implemented in Shanghai. Besides, the Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method was performed to determine indicator weights without integration of value choices. The results showed that the water security condition in Shanghai has gently variated during 2011-2013 and distinctly improved from 2013 (the single score as 0.270) to 2017 (the single score as 0.859). The condition of abrupt environmental events, water use, river quality, and pollution discharge has significantly fluctuated during the investigated period. Policy analysis pointed out that river quality improvement, pollutant control, and wastewater treatment advancement have been the focus throughout the urban water policy measures in Shanghai. However, unstable water resource availability leads to a risk of water security deterioration in Shanghai in the long term and sewage infrastructure planning shall be refined to facilitate sufficient sewage collection. Furthermore, Shanghai shall notice incorporating water use and disaster management into water policy planning to better support water utilization efficiency and urban resilience. This study contributes to the framework development and comparative assessment practices in urban water security studies. The application of the suggested framework and assessment approach can allow policymakers to analyze the improvement needs of urban water security and favor policy design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
