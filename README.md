# 📊Cross sectoral digital planning Drinking Water-Urban Heat-Housing Provision indicators dataset

## 📝 Description

This repository provides a comprehensive dataset designed to support research and analysis at the intersection of **drinking water supply**, **urban heat stress**, and **housing provision**. The dataset includes two main components:

- **📂 Relational Database:**  
  A structured database of indicators across the three urban sectors.

- **📚 Bibliographic Information:**  
  References for all source papers used to extract the indicators.

## 📦 Data Contents

### 1️⃣ Relational Database

The database is available in three formats to support different user needs:

- 🏢 **Microsoft Access (.accdb):** For Access users.
- 🧩 **SQL (.sql):** For use with other relational database systems.
